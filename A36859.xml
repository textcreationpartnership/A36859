            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:204612:3"/>
a charge of Rebellion againſt our Catholick Orthodox Church, and an Apologie for the Doctrine of the Jeſuites. This is ſtroaking and ſtriking together. No blame is ſo diſgraceful as ſuch praiſes. So did the Devil call Chriſt the Son of the living God, to diſgrace him by his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, and make him to be taken for one of his Confederates. The man never appearing to own his work, ſeems to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that neither his perſon nor his work deſerveth the notice of the world. Yet I thought it neceſſary to let the world know what a cheat is put upon the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by this childe of darkneſs, who being altogether unknown to your Grace (as your ſelf were pleaſed to expreſs unto me) beareth himſelf for your ancient Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and claims your Patronage, while he diſgraceth your Perſon, and revileth your Doctrine. Neither doth the Libel,
<pb facs="tcp:204612:3"/>
being but an ignorant ſcolding, deſerve an anſwer; but that the man recompenceth his ſhallow learning with his ſuperlative malice, making uſe of this conjuncture, when the minds of loyal ſubjects are exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated by their late and long ſufferings by rebellious Zelots under pretence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to make the ſufferers to fall out with Religion it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the depths of Satan, who knows perfectly how to ſteer the ſpirits by the Rudder of their moſt ſenſible Intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and at this time labours to drown the too remiſs ſenſe of holy Belief, in the quick reſentments of perſonal oppreſſion. Bleſſed be God that he is come ſhort of his aim in this attempt; and that this Libeller by his Impoſture hath only ſtirred the juſt indignation of good Chriſtians, in whom the intereſs of Gods truth and glory takes place before all perſonal concernments.
<pb facs="tcp:204612:4"/>
Himſelf might have bin an example of that juſt ſeverity which he commends in your Grace, if he had been as bold to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Book, as audacious to Dedicate it to ſo great a Patron. I cannot but have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto the ſame Patron which he hath choſen for his untruths, to protect the confutation of them: Knowing, that the Vindication of the Truth, is in its right place, being put under your Graces prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; in whoſe ſhadow the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth, as of the gracious Patron of Piety and Vertue, the Incourager of Goodneſs, the Maintainer of the Orthodox Faith; and in that reſpect, the right Arm of the great <hi>Defender</hi> of the ſame.

               <p>The Deſigne, Style, and Genius of that Libel. Obſervations upon the Epiſtle and Prefaces.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe licentiouſneſs of the Preſs hath long ſince beaten me to that patience to let others ſpeak, contenting my ſelf to think; Looking upon the eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome men to confute all untruths that appear abroad, as a relick of Knight-Errantry, which obliged the Knights to redreſs all the wrongs that were done in the world. But my patience was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the bold and pernicious untruths vented in a Libel, tending to no leſs then the rooting out of Proteſtants out of all States of the world, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels by their very Religion, and the Bane of all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments. The whole Work is <hi>purum putum mendacium,</hi> right mettle of untruth in the main ſubſtance. The Title is falſe, for it picks a quarrel with the Presbyterians only, whereas the Book de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth open war to all the Proteſtants under heaven.
<pb facs="tcp:204612:6"/>
The pretence falſe; for the Author pretends to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take that task out of love to the King, whereas he works the Kings ruine by calumnies against his true Subjects, and by maintaining the Jeſuites, the ſworn enemies of his Crown and State. The face he puts on, is falſe many wayes; for he pretends in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle and Prefaces to publiſh the Book of a dead man, whereas the uniformity, or rather deformity of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected broken Style, and <hi>Billings</hi>-gate language, in the Epiſtle, Prefaces, and body of the Book, ſhews all that falſe coin to have been ſtampt in the ſame baſe Mint. The Author is produced as a Priest of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> whereas he ſpeaks as a Priest of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Publiſher calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>Bellamy,</hi> whereas he is a <hi>falſe Friend,</hi> and a true Enemy, and most like it is, that no ſuch man as he names himſelf, is to be found: For ſuch Vizards are borrowed by theſe children of darkneſs, A wrong Name, A contrary Profeſſion, A dead man that ſpeaks out of his Grave; three Vizards one over another; lyes upon lyes in the Porch; a right Entry into a Shop of Lyes.</p>
            <p>But how much falſhood is in the Epiſtle? Was <hi>Bellamy</hi> or the pretended dead Author well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with that venerable Prelate to whom the Book is
<pb facs="tcp:204612:6"/>
dedicated? Did <hi>Bellamy</hi> ever preſent the Book to his Lordſhip? Did he chuſe him for his Patron, and ſtroak him with deſerved praiſes, to honour him, or to betray him, and make him odious, as a Patron of Popery, and Protector of Jeſuites? And laſtly, the accuſations laid againſt the ſeveral Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, even theſe that are true, if any be, are they not falſely imputed to the generality of the party? And are not moſt of the alledged paſſages out of their writings maimed, detorted, or plainly forged?</p>
            <p>O God of Truth, who loveſt Truth in the inward parts, and lookeſt with piercing judicial eyes into the bottome of crafty projects through all the coverings of hypocriſie; Is thy Truth to be defended with Falſhood? What followſhip hath the ſimplicity of thy Goſpel with this heap of multiplyed Impoſtures? And how can the zeal of Religion put a man that hath ſome ſenſe of Ingenuity, upon ſuch falſe and crooked wayes? Well, I ſee my ſelf engaged to fight with wilde Beaſts, as St <hi>Paul</hi> did at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Let God ariſe, and let his enemies be ſcattered. Let them alſo that hate him, flee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I did not ſee the Book but after the ſecond Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eight moneths after its first appearing; And
<pb facs="tcp:204612:7"/>
though I had ſeen it before, I would have made no haſte to appear upon the liſts againſt this Adverſary, but expected of the Secular Power a more ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and indeed the right Confutation. But what! the ſmalneſs of the Libel, and the Libeller, kept them hitherto from the Cenſure of Authority: For thoſe that ſtand in high places, can hardly diſcern ſuch ſtrawes below: But we that ſtand below, may look neerer, and ſee poyſon in a ſtraw; and ought to repreſent unto our Superiours the miſchievouſneſs of this ſmall, yet dangerous thing.</p>
            <p>Dangerous I ſay, not for the ſtrength of reaſon, nor for the bitterneſs neither; for the very extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of malice in that Book makes it weak in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as it is the natural effect of pride and choler to enervate the judgement, and take reaſon off the hooks.

Could we believe, but that we ſee it, that in <hi>England,</hi> where the Law gives no Toleration to the Romiſh Religion, a Papist durst appear in Print, with his and his Printers name to the Book, to tax not only the Proteſtant Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but the very Reformation of Rebellion and High Treaſon?

            <p>I pray Sir <hi>Philopapa</hi> (for <hi>Philanax Anglicus</hi> is too good a Title for you) do you know who you ſpeak to? Do you think what you ſay?

            <p>Certainly Sir <hi>Philopapa</hi> (for the Pope is the

Archbiſhop <hi>Juxon,</hi> now a glorious Saint in heaven, whom he hath not ſpared to blame, though he doth not name him, but he points at him with his finger: And then tells My Lord of <hi>London, From all theſe vanities, your Lordſhips known Innocency and Piety hath alwayes defended you;</hi> ſcientifically inferring, that Innocency and Piety is inconſiſtent with the Character which he had given of that great Prelate. Could this Epiſtles be ſo ſenſeleſs as to expect thanks from a Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> for raiſing his commendation upon the diſgrace of his Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan? What needed he to go ſo far out of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to bring in that malicious exception? For the blame of the one adds nothing to the praiſe of the other. Does he not ſhew his hatred against Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Prelates, which he could not but expreſs, even when he took one of them for his Patron? And no wonder that a Jeſuite ſhould maligne an Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> ſeeing the Jeſuites had no greater enemies then thoſe that ſate in that See. That which he findes amiſs in that rarely accompliſhed Prelate, is commended in him by wiſe men, his lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable curioſity, fit for a great Naturalist, as he was; to keep ſeveral ſorts of Animals about his houſe, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did before him: Their Nature and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
<pb facs="tcp:204612:10"/>
he would obſerve with a judicious eye, and ſpeak of them pertinently and delightfully. Of theſe Natural Lectures he was pleaſed to make me hearer ſeveral times, and to imploy me to finde him Books of that ſubject. So ſerious were his Recreations, when he would unbend, among thoſe whom he honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Diſcourſes and Table, after his great Imployments about the Government of Church and State.</p>
            <p>As that great perſon's known <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi> cannot be blaſted by ſuch a weak enemy as this Jeſuite, ſo it needs not be defended by ſuch a weak Champion as I am. His admired Vertue ſhines in an Orb elevated far above the reach of the barking of envie; and if he needed the approbation of any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, he had a Royal Teſtimony, when his late Majeſty, our glorious Saint and Martyr had ſo much confidence in his Piety and Innocency, and together in his Wiſdome and Courage, that of all his Divines he choſe him for his ſecond, when he was to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the terrors of a violent and ignominious death: And by the excellent uſe which he made of his godly counſel in the retirement of his last devotions, he ended his combates in a victorious death over all his enemies ſpiritual and temporal, and yeilded his great
<pb facs="tcp:204612:10"/>
ſoul unto God with joy and comfort. For one thing this Jeſuite and his confreres had great reaſon to hate that godly Prelate; That after His Majeſty had ſpoken many divine words upon the Scaffold, he put him in minde to make a profeſſion of his Religion; which he did, and profeſsed before God and the world, that he dyed a Proteſtant according to the Religion eſtabliſhed by Law in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> A profeſſion which gave great diſcontent to the Papists and the Fanaticks, for both wiſh'd that he had dyed a Papist indeed.</p>
            <p>It is known with what calmneſs of ſpirit, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and magnanimity, that vertuous Prelate went through the tryals which he was put to after the Kings death; for he was as wiſe as a ſerpent, though as harmleſs as a dove: And among his many Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, he was a great Master of two, which ſeldome meet together, a ſingular and <hi>Moſes</hi>-like meekneſs, and an invincible conſtancy. They that have known him moderating in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity, and have ſeen him ſince acting in the greateſt buſineſses of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, admire the readineſs and ſolidity of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fitted alike for ſpeculation and action, and in both excellent. His dexterity and patience, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the most difficult affairs. His ſincerity in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
<pb facs="tcp:204612:11"/>
himſelf without Complements, and his fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in keeping his promiſes without wavering, were very remote from the imputation of <hi>vanity,</hi> which this enemy would faſten upon the reputation of that truly great and good man. I cannot leave, I cannot part from the mention of him, without that reverend and affectionate expreſſion of the Jews when they ſpeak of their vertuous friends departed, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>To return to our Adverſary; Many things in his Epiſtle and Preface ſhew him to be an Adverſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to the whole Proteſtant party, and a ſworn ſlave to the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> But as he takes no pains to prove any thing, but that all Proteſtants are Rebels by their Religion, I will not take the pains to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove any thing elſe.</p>
            <p>All his Preface is <hi>verba &amp; voces;</hi> Moralities far from his purpoſe, interlarded with invectives with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ground.

character more befitting Monaſtical devotion. God fetcheth light out of darkneſs; but it is the Devils work to fetch darkneſs out of light. This man labours to do the ſame, <hi>Sententias loquitur carnifex.</hi> But he goeth untowardly to work: For he pulls his doctrines by the hair to bring them to his uſes. It ſeems the man had made ſome petty declamations when he was a Grammar Scholar, in a broken boyiſh ſtyle, made up of a thouſand ſtollen ſhreds: And now, lest theſe pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of wit ſhould periſh, he brings them in by head and ſhoulders to decide controverſies in points not controverted. For to his ſilly commendations of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi> and <hi>humility,</hi> one may ſay as that King to him that would commend <hi>Hector</hi> in his preſence, <hi>Quis vero illas vituperat?</hi> What need you ſpeak for theſe Vertues, when no body ſpeaks against them?

               <p>For from the beginning to the end, he objects unto us ſome paſſages out of Proteſtant Writers which ſavour of diſobedience, as he dreſſeth them, and ſome faults in that kinde of thoſe that have embraced the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant party: whence he inferreth, That both the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and the Practiſe of Reformed Religion is Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. He labours eſpecially to pick faults in the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:204612:14"/>
but coming ſhort of his end, he quarrelleth with others that came long ſince the Reformation.</p>
               <p>But though he had brought the Reformers to plead guilty, he hath done nothing againſt us; For to all theſe allegations we anſwer, that our Belief depends not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the doctrine of any particular perſon or perſons, much leſs upon their actions. But that to know the true belief of our Churches, one muſt look upon their publick Confeſſions of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Law was received by the diſpoſition of Angels,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Steven,</hi> Act. 7. 53. and ſo was the Goſpel. But thoſe whom God uſed to draw his Church out of the abuſes of Popery were not Angels but men, whom we hold not to have been infallible. Wherefore if one alledge to the Engliſh Churches ſome hard Sayings of perſons that had a hand in the Reformation, to the Germane Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Luther,</hi> to the Helvetian of <hi>Zwinglius;</hi> they will anſwer, They were men. They are not the Pillars of our Faith. Since thoſe men have laid open the Holy Scripture before us which was ſhut up before, it is no more for their word that we believe, for our ſelves have ſeen the ſaving Truth of God, and upon that we are built.</p>
               <p>But that the faults of men may not be imployed or received to give a prejudice againſt the Doctrine of God, I deſire all judicious and ſober minded to conſider, that in the midſt of the Romiſh darkneſs it was not to be expected that the ſaving light of Gods truth, and the Apoſtolical Government of the Church ſhould be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered upon a ſudden by any man, completely &amp; with all its parts. As <hi>Rome</hi> was not built in one day, no more was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:204612:14"/>
                  <hi>Sion.</hi> Many were great helpers towards the knowledge of the truth, who were themſelves very ſhort of it, and nevertheleſs ought to be reverently remembred by us for doing more then was to be expected in that Age. Such were the <hi>Waldenſes;</hi> ſuch was <hi>Wiclef,</hi> ſuch was <hi>John Hus,</hi> men too ſeverely cenſured by ſome of us as not thoroughly principled in many points of Religion. But how much truth did they diſcover? How much ſaving Doctrine did they bring forth? What laſting ſeeds of Reformation did they ſow, which lying buried for ſome Ages, ſprung forth, and had a happy growth to a greater perfection in the age of our Fathers? Truly, although the announcing of the Goſpel by the Angels be called <hi>the Day-ſpring from on high,</hi> becauſe that light<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 78.</note> at Chriſts coming brake forth as it were from the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, not from the Horizon, and was full at its very riſing; we are not to expect at every return of that light after a long night that there ſhall be no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween break of Day and Noon.

And we have reaſon to acknowledge with thankfulneſs and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that among thoſe ſhades ſo much ſaving Light did ſhine as inlightened the underſtanding and comforted the conſcience with the myſtery of Gods reconciliation with men in Jeſus Chriſt through faith and repentance, which is the main ſubſtance of Religion. For Grace as Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> begins with the noble parts, which are

perfectioned long before the outward be finiſht.</p>
               <p>Although I reverence very much the memory of thoſe that were raiſed by God to diſcover the errours of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> I will not juſtifie their errours, if they had any, nor all the words and writings of them that came after, and brought their Work to a greater perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. To compaſs that great work among the higheſt contradiction, and againſt the current of cuſtome, if men of ſtout ſpirits (and there was need of ſuch) had let fall from their mouth or pen ſome leſs reverend expreſſions then duty required concerning the ſuperiour powers that oppoſed them, none needs wonder at it, and yet none needs to juſtifie it, and we are very far from it. But though they had ſpoken treaſon, it caſts no blur upon our profeſſion, which is expreſt in our publick confeſſions. Neither do we acknowledge any private man to be the warrant of our faith.</p>
               <p>I may then ſave my labour in examining whether our Adverſary hath faithfully alledged the writings of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Divines, and truly repreſented their opinions, ſince their opinions are not our rule. And yet ſo much we will ſay for them, that thoſe very men whoſe opinions their Adverſaries miſrepreſent unto the world, were the Writers and Compoſers of thoſe Confeſſions of Faith which were ſubſcribed unto, and acknowledged by the National Churches as the publick Declarations of their belief. Which Confeſſions are ſo full and pregnant in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the obedience of ſubjects unto their Sovereigns (as I will demonſtrate, God willing, in the third Chapter of this Treatiſe) that the greateſt Adverſaries find little to ſay againſt it. And our Adverſary (to whom his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:204612:15"/>
owes this commendation, that he hath carefully colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and epitomized all the objections made againſt us about the point of Obedience) paſſeth by our Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of faith as being without the reach of his exceptions. Onely he nibbleth a little at the 39. Article of the <hi>French</hi> Confeſſion, which is this; <hi>We affirm that Laws are to be obeyed, tributes to be paid, and the yoke of ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be born, although the Magiſtrates be infidels.</hi> Thus far excellent well, ſaith the Adverſary, but that which follows ſpoils all in his opinion. <hi>The Sovereign Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of God remaining alwaies entire,</hi> Why? <hi>here is a gallant latitude</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for diſobedience and rebellion.</hi> But no ſuch latitude is left by the Article. All that good reaſon can infer out of it, is, that we muſt obey the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates as long as we may do it without diſobeying God. There is great difference between not obeying and rebelling.</p>
               <p>I ſee nothing elſe bearing the ſtamp of publick conſent of any National Church among Proteſtants that this man excepts againſt in the point of obedience. For his invective againſt the <hi>Geneva</hi> Bible, is a wilfull miſtake. Some <hi>Engliſh</hi> exiles at <hi>Geneva</hi> printed there a Bible; An Edition juſtly diſcredited by a Note in the Margin, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. 16. upon that <hi>Aſa</hi> put by his mother <hi>Maacha</hi> from the government for her idolatry. And the annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſaith, that he ſhould not onely have depoſed her, but killed her. Which impious Paradox this Gentleman imputeth <hi>to the whole Congregation of thoſe Proteſtants of integrity,</hi> as he calls us, becauſe, ſaith he, <hi>their holy</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva <hi>Bible is admitted by their whole Kirk;</hi> which we deny. No <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation of the Bible is authentical
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:204612:16"/>
to be read in Churches, but that which was made by the commandement of King JAMES of glorious memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Neither was that <hi>Geneva</hi> Bible tranſlated or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by publick authority. Neither is <hi>Geneva</hi> more to be taxed for it, then <hi>London</hi> for printing the wicked libel which I am now confuting, both being printed without Licence. That, Note, put in by ſome Fanatick, is rejected by all Proteſtants, and the generality muſt not be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with a private mans folly.</p>
               <p>Although I anſwer not for any private man, yet that the Reader may judge what credit he may give to this Gentlemans allegations. I have ſet down here a ſample<note place="margin">Pag. 82, and 83.</note> of his unſincerity in his alledging of <hi>Luther.</hi> He ſets down three paſſages taken, as he ſaith, out of <hi>Luther</hi>'s<note place="margin">I made uſe of the Edition of Iena An. 1600 tom. 2. omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum D. Mart. Lutheri,</note> Treatiſe <hi>De Captivitate Babylonica Eccleſiae.</hi> The firſt <hi>cap. De Sacramento Baptiſmi. Ab omnibus hominum le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus exempti ſumus libertate Chriſtiana nobis per Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmum donata;</hi> that is, <hi>We are freed from all humane Laws by the Christian liberty given to us by Baptiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I may confidently affirm that theſe words are not to be found either in that Chapter, or in the whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. And if the Reader will be ſo inquiſitive as to look upon the place, he ſhall find it ſo. There <hi>Luther</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of the ceremonies wherewith the Pope hath clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Sacrament of Baptiſme, and maintaineth that neither Biſhop, nor Pope, nor Angel hath power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch humane additions upon the conſcience of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to be obeyed as Laws. And yet if they be impoſed he will have Chriſtians to bear with them, keeping ſtill to themſelves that liberty of conſcience to remember, that ſuch things are wrongfully impoſed, and taking
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:204612:16"/>
heed either to juſtifie the tyranny, or to murmure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. This is the ſenſe of the whole diſcourſe of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> But he ſaith no where <hi>that the Chriſtian liberty gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us by Baptiſme, exempts us from the Laws of men.</hi> This is a meer fiction.</p>
               <p>So is his ſecond allegation out of the ſame book, <hi>cap. de Matrimonio. Scio nullam Remp. Legibus feliciter administrari.</hi> He makes <hi>Luther</hi> ſay, <hi>I know that no State is happily governed by Lawes:</hi> but there is not one word of that in the whole Chapter of Matrimony, nor in the whole Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion was as farr from that Tenet as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, and the Pope and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave from Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Shall we wonder that the Pope alters the <hi>words</hi> of Scripture making the Text ſay, <hi>ſhe ſhall bruiſe thy heel,</hi> in ſtead of <hi>he,</hi> to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the victory of Chriſt over the Devil unto Chriſts Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or that he giveth to Scripture a contrary <hi>ſenſe,</hi> turning <hi>Feed my ſheep</hi> into <hi>Depoſe Kings, and diſpoſe of Kingdoms?</hi> when ſuch men as our Adverſary take upon them to forge what <hi>words</hi> and <hi>ſenſe</hi> they will, and to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them upon whom they pleaſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quid Domini facient audent cum talia fures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third allegation is out of the Chapter <hi>de Ordine</hi> in the ſame Treatiſe; the words, as our Adverſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites them, are theſe, <hi>Turpe enim est, &amp; iniquiter ſervile Christianum hominem qui liber eſt aliis quam coeleſtibus &amp; divinis legibus ſubjectum eſſe;</hi> that is, <hi>It is a foul thing, and wickedly ſervile, that a Chriſtian man who is free, ſhould be ſubject to any other but the divine and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:204612:17"/>
laws.</hi> But this Gentleman, or he from whom he hath borrowed theſe allegations, hath baſely corrupted and falſified this paſſage, putting <hi>legibus</hi> in ſtead of <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionibus,</hi> which alters the ſenſe altogether, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the queſtion: for <hi>Luther</hi> diſputeth againſt impoſing unneceſſary traditions in Religion, as neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and would not have a Chriſtian to ſubject himſelf in that kind to any <hi>tradition,</hi> but ſuch as are divine and heavenly. But this corrupter repreſents him as refuſing ſubjection to civil laws and temporal powers. Can there be a more ungodly and odious impoſture? And how doth this mans inference follow upon <hi>Luther</hi>'s diſcourſe? <hi>So that it is moſt plain</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that it was not</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'<hi>s deſign onely to pull down Monarchy, but all other kinds of civil Government, and to extirpate all humane laws.</hi> Certainly that inference depends no more upon <hi>Luther</hi>'s diſcourſe, then the new ſtars of <hi>Galilee</hi> upon the Aphoriſms of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a good ſport to ſee how incenſed this Gentleman is againſt <hi>Luther</hi> for exhorting Kings and Princes to fall upon the Pope and his Cardinals, and to fulfill the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. That the Kings of the earth ſhall ſtrip the great harlot naked, devour her ſelf, and burn her with fire. Which he exagerates as high treaſon, becauſe he acknowledgeth the Pope for his Sovereign, and the King of kings, whom none can reſiſt or call to account without incurring the crime of Rebellion.</p>
               <p>For his other allegations againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> he ſhall not have the luck to be believed upon his word, after I have laid open his infidelity in that kind. He that hath lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or curioſity enough, may ſearch the places and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:204612:17"/>
whether they be true or falſe, neither of which concerns us. Yet a judicious view of the affairs of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> at that time, and of the nature of Sovereignty and Subjection in the Empire, of which I intend to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the next Chapter, which will make his hardeſt expreſſions to ſeem leſs ſtrange.</p>
               <p>It is certain that he writ againſt King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. moſt slovenly. Yet obſerve, that <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. was not his King. That he ſaid nothing againſt the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence due to him by his ſubjects, and that he made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to the King ſince, and cryed <hi>Peccavi.</hi> He was then leſs to blame then the Jeſuite <hi>Sander,</hi> who called<note place="margin">Sander. lib. de Schiſmate Anglica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no.</note> the ſame King (his natural Prince) <hi>another</hi> Mahomet, <hi>the root of ſin, and a moſt impious and ſacrilegious Tyrant,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth Lupam Anglicanam, the Engliſh wolf-bitch,</hi> and made them no amends for it.</p>
               <p>This teſtimony cannot be denied to <hi>Luther,</hi> that he oppoſed rebellion moſt vigorously; as it may be ſeen<note place="margin">Sleidan. lib. 5. ad an. 1525. Id. lib. 14. ad an. 1542.</note> in his Epiſtle to the Boors that roſe in arms, and by his Sermon in the Camp, both pregnant for the obedience of ſubjects to their Princes; of which <hi>Sleidan</hi> giveth a faithfull account, a better Author then our Adverſary, or <hi>Cochlaeus Luther</hi>'s enemy.</p>
               <p>The firſt and greateſt inſtrument of the <hi>Helvetian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> out of whoſe books the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary picks ſome paſſages to exhort the <hi>Switzers</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> to defend their Religion againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. If there had been no quarrel of Religion at that time, yet he would have exhorted them to ſtand for their liberties againſt the Emperour. For the <hi>Switzers</hi> having ſhaken off the yoke of the Empire two hundred
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:204612:18"/>
years before. It is no marvel that <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was not carefull to exhort his Countreymen and neighbours to obedience to the Emperour, the perpetual underminer of the State which he lived in.</p>
               <p>Obſerve that the Authours that write of the power of Princes, and of the duty of ſubjects, determine it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the form of the States in which they live: and ſo no wonder that <hi>Zuinglius</hi> a <hi>Switzer</hi> acknowledgeth no ſucceſſive power, but conceiveth all Princes to be eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible and depoſable by the Commonwealth. And that <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> living in an Ariſtocratical State, ſhewed alſo in their Writings more inclination towards that kind of Government. So the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Writers are for a mixt and much limitted Government. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> for Monarchy, with certain Laws. And if the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Muſcovites</hi> could make Books, they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would write for the Deſpotical and unlimitted power.</p>
               <p>Our Adverſary layeth a heavy charge upon <hi>Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> that he ſhould ſay that <hi>the inferiour Magistrates</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 105. Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton in Epit. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Philoſ. Id. in lib. de Conſil. Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</note> 
                  <hi>may cut the throats of the ſuperiour, and all this for refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Religion:</hi> for which he referreth us to two of his Books, without quoting the particular place; much like the direction of the Goodwifes Letter, <hi>To my Husband dwelling at the wars.</hi> But no ſuch thing ſhall be found in all <hi>Melanchton</hi>'s Works. Neither is it ſuitable to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of that wiſe and meek man.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Calvin,</hi> by reaſon of his Ariſtocratical Doctrine about the Tribunitian power of the <hi>tres ordines regni</hi> over the King: I would leave him for ſuch as he is; but that it is my proper buſineſs at this time to diſcover the impoſture of my Adverſary, and he hath committed a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:204612:18"/>
ſignal one againſt <hi>Calvin,</hi> whom he hath ſerved juſt as he did <hi>Luther</hi> before. For he brings him upon the Stage,</p>

                  <hi>the King,</hi> he ſaith, that <hi>to all oaths of this nature Mr.</hi> Calvin <hi>from his high Cathedral and Conſiſtorial Tribunal gives this abſolution; Quibuscunque hujus Evangelii lux affulget,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ab omnibus laqueis &amp; juramentis abſolvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> I cannot make good <hi>Engliſh</hi> of falſe <hi>Latine,</hi> of which <hi>Calvin</hi> is not guilty, but it is as familiar with this Gentleman as falſe Doctrine. His meaning is to make <hi>Calvin</hi> ſay, that when a man is inlightened with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of <hi>Geneva,</hi> he is free from all oathes to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign; for it is of <hi>all oathes of that nature</hi> that he makes <hi>Mr.</hi> Calvin <hi>to give abſolution.</hi> But there is a ſwarm of corruptions in that allegation.

               <p>I cannot pardon this Gentleman his prevarication a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Calvin,</hi> though I ſhould make a digreſſion for it; for is it not good ſport to ſee him defend <hi>Calvin</hi> when he takes upon him to defame him?

Calvin <hi>from his youth did macerate his body with faſting; whither it was to preſerve his health, and by that abſtinence diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the fumes of meagrom wherewith he was afflicted, or that he might thereby be the more free to write, ſtudy, and exerciſe his memory. The truth is, that hardly could a man be found that equalled</hi> Calvin <hi>in laboriouſneſs.

               <p>Well, Sir Jeſuite, do you tax <hi>Calvin</hi> of Epicureiſme after your confreres, and bring convincing proofs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it?

               <p>The Adverſary having done with <hi>Calvin,</hi> falls upon <hi>Beza,</hi> a man for whom I am leſs partial then for any of the Reformed Divines, herein heir of my Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers dislike of him for daſhing the fair hopes of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Religion in the Colloquy of <hi>Poiſſy</hi> by his immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate behaviour. But to lay a charge upon <hi>Beza</hi>'s Doctrine about the point of the authority of Kings, and obedience of ſubjects, he ſhould have taken allegations out of <hi>Beza</hi>'s undoubted Writings, not out of pieces without name, aſcribed to him by his enemies. Such is <hi>Euſebius Philadelphus:</hi> Such is the treatiſe <hi>de jure Magistratus,</hi> which this very Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſaith to be aſcribed by ſome to <hi>Hottoman.</hi> Such is alſo <hi>Junius Brutus;</hi> concerning whom we ſtand to the Oracle of our Engliſh <hi>Solomon</hi> King JAMES in his <hi>Defenſe of the right of Kings</hi> againſt Cardinal <hi>Perron.</hi> Junius Brutus, <hi>when he objects unto us, is an unknown

The judgement of the learned <hi>Rivet</hi> to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is ingenuous and prudent, that theſe things muſt be imputed to the hot and audacious brains of the <hi>Scots,</hi> then heated again by perſecution. Let me adde, that when the perſecution was pretty well overcome, they were kept in their heat by ſharp contention. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then a Royal Baſtard, who pretending that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had once a deſigne to make him King, followed that deſigne very cloſe, yet cloſely, raiſing all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles he could againſt the Kings Widow, and his legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Heir: for which the difference of Religion hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening about that time, gave him fair play; for all his ambitious projects were cloaked with the furtherance of the cauſe of the Goſpel. This was the man that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced that divinity of rebellion.</p>
               <p>Which that it may not be imputed to the Religion, I deſire all judicious heads maturely to ponder Dr. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet</hi>'s wiſe obſervation; That the <hi>Scots</hi> of a hundred and five Kings, which they reckon till Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> had
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:204612:21"/>
depoſed three, expelled five, and killed thirty five. I demand then whether all thoſe exceſſes muſt be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the doctrine and zeal of Religion. If ſo, let the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks look how they ſhall defend their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which then was prevalent. But if that muſt be imputed to the bold and ſtirring Genius of the Nation, why ſhall the troubles riſen under the Queen Regent of <hi>Scotland</hi> and her daughter <hi>Mary</hi> be aſcribed to Religion, and Reformation, ſuppoſed the cauſe, not the occaſion, by the managing of crafty ſelf-ſeeking men, of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of the State, and the intemperance of pens? Yea, it ſhall be found, as Dr. <hi>Rivet</hi> obſerveth, (and we find it now) that the light of the Evangelical truth did very much mitigate the fierceneſs of the Nation; and that thoſe diſorders, as turbulent as they were, are not comparable to thoſe that were in former times in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> which as we are too ingenuous to aſcribe to the Religion of thoſe dayes, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ought to ſhew the like ingenuity about the exceſſes of wits and ſwords ſince the coming of the Reformation.</p>
               <p>It were to no purpoſe to follow all the objections of this Gentleman out of Proteſtant Writers; ſince whether they be well or ill alledged, our belief is not ingaged in their ill opinions, nor our reputation concerned in the wrong done to them by perverſe and unfaithfull allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I have diſcovered ſo many of them, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may well miſtruſt his other citations. If all were as they are repreſented, they are but ſo many Doctours o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions ſtrengthened with no approbation of perſons au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized for it. And to ſpeak after our Moſt Excellent <hi>King</hi> JAMES in his <hi>Defenſe of the right of Kings. I
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:204612:21"/>
would not defend all that ſome private men could ſay. It is enough that in our Religion there is no rule to be found that preſcribeth rebellion, nor any thing that diſpenſeth ſubjects from the oath of their allegiance, nor any of our Churches that receive that abominable doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is ſpoken with a Royal brevity, and an imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous weight, which both confutes all objections in that kind, and together ſilently retorts upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, that among them they have rules that preſcribe rebellion, and an authority diſpenſing from the oath of allegiance, and that their Church is commanded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that abominable doctrine.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed be God, our doctrine about the point of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience never gave yet jealouſie to Kings, though of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Religion. Whereas the Sovereign Courts of the ſame Princes have expelled the Jeſuites for teaching and practiſing the murther of Kings, and condemned the Popes Bulls to be torn for ſowing rebellion among the people. Is it not a matter for no leſſe patience then that of God, to ſee thoſe that teach rebellion by the publick expreſſe laws of the head of their Church, now to charge our Churches with rebellion for ſome words of private men, either falſly imputed unto them, or diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the generality of the Proteſtant Churches? Is it for him that hath cut the purſe to cry, ſtop the thief? Muſt the Doctors of high treaſon lay an action of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt us, in effect becauſe we will not be rebels with them, and acknowledge a King above our King? for when all is ſaid, that is the ground of the quarrel, and we can buy our peace with them at no other rate.

               <p>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> was a man of an invincible ſpirit; one that ſpared neither King nor Pope, when the Truth of God which he announced was oppoſed: And in his expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, one that ſpake down right without mincing. Yet as ſtout as he was, I find that he behaved himſelf with great modeſty and patience with the Pope for a great while: And in all his Addreſſes to him for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of the horrible abuſes reigning in the Church, he uſed a Chriſtian humility and ſubmiſſion to the Popes pleaſure, if his Holineſs would have hearkened to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and reaſon, and remembred the duty of his place. But when the Pope and the great Clergy of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> uſed him with the utmoſt ſcorn and inhumanity, he paid them in the ſame coin. The Pope burnt his <hi>Theſes,</hi> and he burnt the Popes <hi>Decretals</hi> in the market place; and writ againſt the higheſt of the Roman Clergy in high terms, a crime much exaggerated by our Adverſary. This is all the rebellion (if they call it ſo) that either <hi>Luther</hi> or the beginning of the Reformation
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:204612:23"/>
can be charged with. For the Reformation was embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by many Princes and Imperial Cities ſo freely and ſo quietly, that the Adverſary could finde no ground to object any other rebellion unto them but that againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who in effect was neither their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop nor their Prince.</p>
               <p>So that which our Adverſary (after others) objects againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> That he exhorted the Emperour, Kings<note place="margin">pag. 74. <hi>Luther in Sylveſtriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pruratem.</hi> Si ſures ſurcâ, ſi latrones gladio, ſi haereticos igne ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctimus, cur non magis i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtos magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtros per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionis, hos Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinales, hos Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas, &amp; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam iſtam Romanae Sodomae colluviem quae Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiam Dei ſine fine cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumpit, omnibus armis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petimus?</note> and Princes to <hi>fall upon the Pope and Cardinals, and all the filth of the Roman Sodom,</hi> is nothing to the queſtion in hand. For there <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeaks not of any inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſubjects againſt their lawfull Sovereign, but of the juſtice which the Princes of Chriſtian Provinces ought to exerciſe againſt the Tyrants and Corruptors of the Church. He had tryed all means of Piety, Charity, Equity, and Reaſon. When all would not ſerve, and that the Pope and the Cardinals would neither reform the Church nor themſelves, nor admit of an Appeal to the Councel for that great Work, then <hi>Luther</hi> brake out into theſe words: <hi>Mihi verò videtur, ſi ita pergat furor Romaniſtarum, nullum eſſe reliquum remedium quàm ut Imperator, Reges &amp; Principes vi &amp; armis accincti, aggrediantur has peſtes Orbis terrarum, rémque non jam verbis ſed ferro decernant.</hi> That is, <hi>It is my opinion, if the fury of the Romanists continue, that there is no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy remaining but that the Emperour, Kings, and Princes who are furniſht with force and arms, ſhould take theſe plagues of the world in hand, and decide the quarrel no more with words but with the ſword.</hi> And then follow the words written in our margent which are a continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his exhortation to the Higher Powers to make
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:204612:23"/>
uſe againſt them of the ſword of Juſtice. This is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then to ſet on private men to ſtab them, or ſtirr the rabble to fall upon them according to the maxims and practiſe of the Jeſuits. But <hi>Luther</hi> went the right way to work, when he exhorted thoſe to whom God had committed the power of the ſword, to make uſe of it to repreſs the tyranny and oppreſſion both ſpiritual and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil uſed in their Dominions by a foreign uſurped power; and the rather, becauſe the Emperour and the Princes had been very earneſt with the Pope to remove by his Paſtoral care all the cauſes of complaint.</p>
               <p>It is objected againſt <hi>Luther</hi> and his party, that they entred into a Confederacy of defenſive arms at <hi>Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cald;</hi> that <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf made a book <hi>contra duo Mandata Caeſaris,</hi> againſt two Edicts of the Emperour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that in his book <hi>de bello contra Turcas, he denyed the Emperour to be the Head of the Christian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth:</hi> But to judge aright of that Confederacy, and of the opinions of the German Divines and Lawyers about the Emperours Rights, and of the Warrs of that Age between the Emperour and the Princes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, we muſt conſider the conſtitution of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Germany.</hi> And to that end look to their <hi>Magna Charta</hi> which is <hi>Bulla aurea</hi> made under the Emperour CHARLES IV. and <hi>Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio</hi>

               <p>Three hundred and fifty years before that, a German Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> V. had brought in the Inſtitution of the <hi>Electors,</hi> as the Centuriators of <hi>Magdeburg</hi> report. But <hi>Aventinus</hi> and <hi>Onuphrius</hi> more credibly make it of later date, after the death of <hi>Frederick</hi> II. whom Pope <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> IV. had perſecuted to death; and the Empire being much weakned by the loſs of that great Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, to weaken him more yet, either <hi>Innocent</hi> IV. or his Succeſſor <hi>Alexander</hi> III. procured ſeven perpetual Electors, whoſe Intereſt ſhould be to keep alwaies the Emperours low to keep themſelves high. Since that time the Emperours Authority in many parts of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> is little more then a title, and a reſpect without power; for the Electors may both elect and depoſe him. They and the other Princes of the Empire govern their Signories, and pay nothing to him but homage. And the Cities called <hi>Imperial</hi> are they that have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt exemptions from the Imperial Lawes. Wherefore the exclamations of the Adverſaries about the reſiſtance of the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> with other Princes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and ſome Imperial Cities againſt the Emperour, and about the words of German Divines or Juriſts to that purpoſe; are very ignorantly or maliciously urged as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:204612:24"/>
rebellious; for neither the words nor the actions of thoſe <hi>Germans</hi> ought to be weighed in the balance of the duty of other ſubjects to their abſolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> who was always very rigid for the ſubjection of every ſoul to the higher powers, and had written a book expresly of that ſubject, had much ado to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to conſent to a confederacy of defenſive arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Emperour; who being ſet on by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> oppreſſed the liberties of <hi>Germany;</hi> and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the growing Reformation took more cognizance of caſes belonging to the jurisdiction of the Princes, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Empire, then he was allowed by the authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal capitulations, till<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the learned in the Law ſatisfied him about the Statutes of his Countrey, and his reaſon and conſcience ſhewed him, that the Apoſtle command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtians to <hi>ſubmit themſelves to every ordinance of man for the Lords ſake,</hi> requireth of them an obedience proportioned to the conſtitutions of the States, of which they are members.

For Luther had taught alwayes that the Magistrate muſt not be reſisted, and a book of his concerning that ſubject was extant. But when in that conſultation the learned in law ſhewed that it was permitted
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:204612:25"/>
by the laws to reſist ſometimes, and demonſtrated that at that time their buſineſs was come to that very caſe, of which the laws make mention among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things; Luther did ingeniouſly profeſs that he knew not that it was lawfull: And becauſe the Goſpel doth not impugne or aboliſh the Politick laws, as he had alwayes taught. Alſo becauſe, the time being ſo perillous and full of terrour, many things might happen which would put the armes in our hands, not onely by the preſcript of the law, but by the force of conſcience and neceſſity, he declared his opinion, that a defenſive League might juſtly be made whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Emperour himſelf, or any other in his name ſhould make war against us.</q>
               <p>While they were thus met at <hi>Smalcald,</hi> the Emperour ſent letters to them, not to condemn or diſſolve their meeting, as a King of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>France</hi> would have done, for he knew that by the laws they might meet to look to their common intereſt without him, yea and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. But to charge the Proteſtants to ſend help againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> who was advancing with a great army towards <hi>Germany.</hi> The Proteſtants anſwered, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Emperour would grant them no peace at home, nor ſuſpenſion of the decree of confiſcation againſt their eſtates for their Religion, and that they were in daily expectation of proſcription and hoſtile dealing from him, they could not cut off their own ſinews, and lay themſelves open to his hoſtility to help him againſt a foreign enemy.

               <p>If it be objected, that this abridging of the Emperours power was wrongfully got from him, I will grant it: It was <hi>jus quod coepit ab injuria; a right that began by wrong;</hi> yet confirmed by the Emperours with authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Charters, and ſtrengthened by long preſcription. The Emperour may thank the Popefor it, who having an ancient jealouſie of the Imperial rights in <hi>Italy,</hi> and not able to ſuffer any <hi>King of the Romans,</hi> but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, have powerfully laboured for many ages to break the Emperours power every where. And it was by their practiſes, that the conſtitution of the Electors and the Golden Bull was made, and thoſe great immunities gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Princes of the Empire and Imperial Cities, whereby the Emperour is remained a manacled Prince; ſo unable in moſt parts of the Empire to ſtretch his hands upon the meaneſt perſons that trouble him, that he could never ſo much as ſecure <hi>Luther</hi> a poor Monk, though urged to it by the moſt powerfull and irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſollicitations of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> but <hi>Luther</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till death (about thirty years) deſtroying the Popes intereſts in <hi>Germany,</hi> and all parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and neither Pope nor <hi>Caeſar</hi> could touch him.

After that many words had paſt between them, when none appeared that had any thing to oppoſe, the Senate made an Edict, that in all their dominions the Goſpel ſhould be purely taught out of the Books of the Old and New Teſtament, and that humane traditions ſhould be baniſht.

The <hi>Switzers</hi> had cantoned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the year 1315. which was 200<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> years before the Reformation. Were I as unſincere as my Adverſary, I ſhould charge the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion which then reigned with that change of State.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Zuinglius</hi> the Adverſary paſſeth to <hi>Calvin</hi> as the head of the <hi>French</hi> Reformation, wherein he ſheweth his great ignorance; for the Reformed Religion was ſpread in <hi>France</hi> twenty years before <hi>Calvin</hi> was ſettled in <hi>Geneva,</hi> and well nigh aſſoon as in <hi>Germany.</hi> The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of which muſt not be aſcribed to one <hi>Hugo,</hi> whom our Adverſary knowsnot, nor any body elſe. But the truth is, that it was in <hi>France</hi> long before it was in <hi>Germany,</hi> ever ſince the errours and tyranny of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> began to be oppoſed by the <hi>Valdenſes,</hi> whoſe relicks after long perſecutions by fire and ſword, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Vale of <hi>Cabrieres</hi> and <hi>Marindol</hi> in <hi>Provence.</hi> It was from thence that Reformation was propagated, incouraged by the happy progreſſes of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius.</hi> Wherefore the Popes creatures perceiving whence that blow came upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, never left ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing <hi>Francis</hi> the I. of <hi>France,</hi> till they got an Edict for the extirpating of them, which was executed with the utmoſt rigour.</p>
               <p>And it was not for Religion that they were thus butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, but meerly to make a ſacrifice to the pride and cruelty of <hi>Rome.</hi> For as for their doctrine that excellent King <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. liked it ſo well, that to ſome
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:204612:27"/>
that repreſented it to him, and would incenſe him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. He anſwered, that they were better Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians then he and his Kingdome.</p>
               <p>This was then the true <hi>Origine</hi> of the Reformation of <hi>France,</hi> the doctrine of the <hi>Valdenſes</hi> preſerved in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of their deſcent: a doctrine perfectioned ſince into a more Orthodox Confeſſion conformable to the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of other Proteſtant Churches. So <hi>Calvin</hi> had no hand in that Reformation, and no more had he with that of <hi>Geneva,</hi> or in turning that State into an Ariſtocracy, as this Adverſary upbraids him.</p>
               <p>My buſineſs being to vindicate Reformation from the charge of rebellion, I muſt take from the Reformers of <hi>Geneva</hi> that aſperſion, that they expelled their Biſhop, and that they altered the conſtitution of that State, and both theſe aſcribed unto <hi>Calvin.</hi> It is a tradition recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>England</hi> for a currant and undoubted truth. And upon that ground many fine and judicious inferences are built. But it is like the ſtories of the Phenix, and the ſinging of Swans before their death, never the truer for the curious ſimilies and ingenious moralities that have<note place="margin">Epiſtola Benedicti. Turretini ad Sculte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum in Annal. reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis An. 1529.</note> been ſpun out of that ſtuffe. What credit can we give to Hiſtories of things happened in the <hi>Indies</hi> two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years ago, if in things done to lately, and ſo near us, groſs miſtakes go for uncontrollable truths? I ſay it is utterly falſe thar <hi>Calvin</hi> was one of the planters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion at <hi>Geneva.</hi> Falſe alſo that he or the Reformers of <hi>Geneva</hi> turned their Biſhop out of doors. And falſe alſo that the Biſhop went away upon the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of Religion. <hi>Farel, Froment,</hi> and <hi>Viret</hi> were they that wrought under God the converſion of the City by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:204612:27"/>
their Sermons, and by a publick conference with the Friars and Clergy of <hi>Geneva,</hi> there being then no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in that Town, who was fled eight moneths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſeeing his conſpiracy diſcovered, to oppreſſe the liberties of the City, by the help of the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> for which his Secretary was hanged, after he was gone; the ſaid Biſhop being hated before, for the rape of a Virgin, and many adulteries with Citizens Wives. And it is moſt to be noted, that they who after his flight<note place="margin">See the book en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, A view of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, &amp;c. by <hi>Iohn Durel.</hi>
                  </note> reformed the Civil Government, were ſtrong Papiſts, and mainly oppoſed the Reformation of Religion. To which ſomething like was ſeen in <hi>England,</hi> not far from that time: For the ſame Engliſh Biſhops that moſt earneſtly ſerved <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. to make him acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Supreme Head of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tonſtal. Gardiner. Bonner &amp;c.</note> were afterwards the greateſt oppoſers of the Work of Reformation, and the fierceſt perſecutors of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</p>
               <p>That the Church Diſcipline of <hi>Geneva</hi> was conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without a biſhop, is a matter of another nature: Their Succeſſors that continue it ſo to this day, are of age, let them ſpeak for themſelves. It is enough for my preſent purpoſe, that I have vindicated the Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Reformation into that State, from the crime of rebellion.</p>
               <p>As long as their Biſhop lived, they could not have another, and durſt not receive him, being manifeſtly convicted of ſelling the Cities liberty to the Duke of <hi>Savoy:</hi> And when the Biſhop died, they had uſed themſelves to live without a Biſhop.</p>

                  <hi>Charls</hi> the IX. being under age, the Princes of the blood had more right then before, to claim the management of the publick affairs, being intruſted with them by the Laws of the Kingdome in the Kings minority, at leaſt in conjunction with the Queen Mother. And being excluded from it again they raiſed an Army to recover their right. That right is not conſidered at all by Jeſuites, that take upon them now a hundred years after to cenſure their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but theſe Princes and their followers are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented onely as Hereticks and Rebels that made Warre againſt their Sovereigne.</p>
               <p>After the King was out of minority, the Princes and their party, ſeeing that the King was much incenſed againſt them, and was of a dangerous and implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nature, durſt not come neer him; and the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Maſſacres, made them keep themſelves in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of defence, and repel force by force.</p>
               <p>To be rid of them at once, the King uſed that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and unparallelled treachery of a feigned peace with the Proteſtants, ſealed with the Marriage of his Siſter with the Head of their party, the firſt Prince of the blood next to his Brothers, <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Navarre;</hi> and having invited them to the Wedding, he slew them in their beds.

If ſome few Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks have fought for our glorious King and Martyr <hi>Charles</hi> the I. their whole party fares the better by it now, and finds the King a grateful Prince, remembring good deeds, and forgetting injuries: Then the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their doctrine in point of Government, ought to make a great difference in the allowance of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick exerciſe of their Religion. The Jeſuited Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks acknowledge another Sovereigne over their King, both for the Spiritual and the Temporal, a forreigne power, which can diſpenſe them of their Allegiance to him. The Proteſtants acknowledge no Sovereigne above their King, and give no jealouſie by their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to the Roman Catholick Princes and States un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they live, as the Jeſuites have done, even to Roman Catholicks, by whom they have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled out of their Dominions, as Teachers of a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine tending to rebellion.</p>
               <p>Of the troubles that followed, who ſo will give an impartial judgement, muſt look upon the condition of the French Proteſtants ſince King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. bought
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:204612:31"/>
his peace with the party of the League by the change of his Religion. That King ſeeing himſelf obliged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the ſafety of his Proteſtant ſubjects, by whoſe armes and long ſervice he had been preſerved in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, and finally placed upon the Royal Seat, gave them ſome places of ſtrength in ſeveral Provinces of the Kingdome for certain years; and by an Edict (called the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi>) the free enjoying of their eſtates, and the open exerciſe of their Religion, with ſome limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of places.</p>
               <p>Of the priviledges granted them by that Edict, there were many infractions, eſpecially ſince the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. who both by his authority, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his ancient intereſt in the Proteſtant party, kept all quiet, and preſerved them from thoſe wrongs to which the weakeſt are alwaies obnoxious.</p>
               <p>The term being expired of the grant of thoſe places, King <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII. renewed it for four or five years, after which he would have them out of their hands. That they were to be reſtored upon the Kings demand, was the opinion of grave Proteſtants, the ſevereſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the obedience of ſubjects to the Sovereign; of my Reverend Father eſpecially, who being eminent and reſpected in the party, was a principal means to keep the Proteſtant Churches on this ſide <hi>Loire</hi> in peace and in duty to their King, for which his Majeſty ſent him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſumme of money, which he refuſed to take, ſaying, that he could be loyal to his King without being bought.</p>
               <p>But the neceſſity of their keeping thoſe places, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be juſtified by the reaſon of the firſt grant, which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:204612:32"/>
was to preſerve them from the violence of their bitter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; for (ſaid they) if ſo many places of ſafety could not keep us ſafe from their inſolence, what will become of us when we ſhall lye naked of all defenſe, and expoſed to the will of that party which uſed us before like ſheep appointed to the slaughter?</p>
               <p>Upon thoſe terms they were when the Aſſembly of<note place="margin">The Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Rochel was not an Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Politick Aſſembly, for thoſe two ſorts of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to keep, but now the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick only is allowed.</note> 
                  <hi>Rochel</hi> being once licenced by their King, and ſince for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, ſate againſt his will, and took order for a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive war. Whereupon, my Reverend Father returning from the National Synod of <hi>Alais,</hi> of which he had been Preſident, writ a Letter to them, which I inſert here as very pertinent to my purpoſe.</p>

                        <hi>I</hi> do not write to you to powr my ſorrows into your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, or to entertain you with my private croſſes: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that I need no comforter, accounting it a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that in the publick affliction of the Church, God would have me to march in the front. And I would account it a great happineſs if all the ſtorm ſhould light on my head, ſo that I were the onely ſufferer, and the Church of God ſhould enjoy peace and proſperity. A more ſmarting care hath moved me to write to you, and forced me to go beyond my nature, which was alwayes averſe from medling with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick buſineſſes, and from moving out of the ſphere of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per calling. For ſeeing the general body of the Church in eminent danger, and upon the brink of a diſmal precipice, it was not poſſible for me to keep ſilence. Nay, I cannot be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:204612:32"/>
ſilent in this urgent neceſſity, without drawing upon me the guilt of inſenſibility and Cruelty towards the Church of God. And I am full of hope that while I deliver my mind to you about publick buſineſſes, my domeſtick afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will free me from jealouſies in your opinion. And if I be not believed, at least I ſhall be excuſed. Indeed it doth not become me to take upon me to give counſel to an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of perſons choſen out of the whole Kingdome to bear the burden of the publick affairs in a time ſo full of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yet I think it uſefull for you to be truly informed what the ſenſe is, and what the diſpoſition of our Churches<note place="margin">None could have a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, then he who was lately come from the National Synod in the South of France, where he made it his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to obſerve the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the affairs of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</note> by perſons that have a particular knowledge of it.</p>
                     <p>The question being then, whether you ought to ſeparate your Aſſembly to obey his Majeſty, or keep together to give order to the affairs of the Churches, I am obliged to tell you, that the general deſire of our Churches is, that it may pleaſe God to continue our peace in our obedience to his Majeſty. And that ſeeing the King reſolved to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obeyed by the force of his armes, they truſt, that you will do your beſt to avoid that ſtorm, and rather yield un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to neceſſity, then to ingage them in a war which moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly will ruine most part of our Churches, and will bring us into a trouble, of which we ſee the beginning, but can ſee no end. By obeying the King you ſhall take away the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence uſed by thoſe that ſet his Majesty on to perſecute us: and if we muſt be perſecuted, all that fear God deſire that it may be for the profeſſion of the Goſpel, and that our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution may truly be the croſs of Chriſt. In one word, I can aſſure you, Gentlemen, that the <hi>greateſt and beſt part</hi> of our Churches wiſheth for your ſeparation, if it may be with the ſafety of your perſons: yea, that many of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>

Church deſiring the publick peace, are continually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, beſeeching and exhorting us that we do not by caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves headlong, involve them in the ſame ruine.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon I need not repreſent unto you how terribly and generally our poor flocks are frighted and diſmayed, caſting their eyes upon you, as perſons that may procure their reſt, and by yielding to the preſent neceſſity, blow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the storm hanging over their heads. Many already have forſaken the land, many have forſaken their Religion; whence you may judge what diſſipation is like to follow, if this exaſperation go on further.</p>
                     <p>No more do I need to recommend unto you to have a tender care of the preſervation of our poor Churches, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that you would chuſe death, rather then to draw that reproach upon you, that you have haſtened the perſecution of the Church, and deſtroyed that which the zeal of our Fathers have planted, and that you have put this State in confuſion.</p>
                     <p>I am not ignorant, that many reaſons are alledged to perſwade you to continue your Aſſembly, they tell you that the King hath granted it; but for that grant of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty you can ſhow no Warrant, nor any written Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without which all promiſes are but words in the air: for Kings believe they have power to forbid that which they have permitted, and to revoke that which they have granted, when they judge it expedient for the good of their affairs. Neither is there any of you, after he hath ſent his ſervant, or given him leave to goe to ſome place, that thinks not that he hath power to call him back. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Princes eſpecially, are very unwilling to keep their promiſes, when they have been extorted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:204612:33"/>Alſo great number of grievances and contraventions to the Kings Edicts are repreſented unto you, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, to our great grief, are too true. But that I may not urge that we have given occaſion to many of thoſe evils our own ſelves, the difficulty lyeth not in repreſenting our griefs, but in finding the remedies. Conſider then whether the ſubſistence of your Aſſembly can heal all theſe ſores; whether your ſitting can give a ſhelter to our Churches, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide all things neceſſary for a war where the parties are ſo unequal, raiſe forces, and make a ſtock to pay them; Whether all the good that your ſitting can produce can countervail the diſſipation of ſo many Churches which lye open to the wrath of their enemies: Whether when they are fallen you can raiſe them again: Whether in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent diviſion that is amongus, you are able to rally the ſcattered parts of that divided body, which if it were well united, yet would be too weak to stand upon the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>
                     <p>Pardon me, Gentlemen, if I tell you that you ſhall not find all our Proteſtants inclined to obey your reſolutions; and that the fire being kindled all about you, ſhall remain helpleſs beholders of the ruine which you have drawn on our heads. Neither can it be unknown to you, that many of the beſt quality among us, and best able to defend us, openly blame your actions, holding and profeſſing, that ſuffering for this cauſe is not ſuffering for the cauſe of God. Theſe making no reſiſtance, and opening the gates of their places, or joining their armes with the Kings, you may eaſily judge what loſs and what weakning of the party that will be. How many of our Nobility will forſake y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:204612:34"/>
in an Aſſembly are moſt vehement in their votes, and to<note place="margin">And ſo it proved.</note> ſhew themſelves zealous, are altogether for violent waies, are very often they that will revolt and betray their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. They bring our diſtreſſed Churches to the hottest danger, and there leave them, going away after they have ſet the houſe on fire.</p>
                     <p>If there be once fighting or beſieging of our towns, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the iſſue may be of the combat or the ſiege, all that while it will be hard to keep the people animated against us, from falling upon our Churches, which have neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat nor defenſe. And what order ſoever the Magiſtrates of contrary Religion take about it, they ſhall never be able to compaſs it.</p>
                     <p>I might alſo repreſent unto you many reaſons out of the ſtate of our Churches, both within and without the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to ſhew you that this ſtirring of yours is altogether unſeaſonable, and that you ſet ſail against wind and tyde. But you are clear-ſighted enough to ſee it, and to conſider in what poſture your neighbours are, and from whence you may look for help; whether among you the vertue and the concord, and the quality of the heads is grown or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht. Certainly this is not the time when the troubling of this pool can heal our diſeaſes. And certain it is, that if any thing can help ſo much weakneſs, it muſt be the zeal of Religion, which in the time of our fathers hath upholden us, when we had leſs strength, and more vertue. But in this cauſe you ſhall find that zeal languiſhing, becauſe <hi>moſt of our people</hi> believe that this evil might have been avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without breach of conſcience. Be ye ſure that there will be alwaies diſunion among us, every time that we ſhall ſtir for civil cauſes, and not directly for the cauſe of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:204612:34"/>Againſt that it is objected, that our enemies have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined our ruine; that they undermine us by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; that it is better to begin now, then to ſtay longer. Truly that man ſhould be void of common ſenſe, that doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their ill will. And yet when I call to mind our ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral loſſes, as that of <hi>Lectoure, Privas,</hi> and <hi>Bearn,</hi> I finde that we ourſelves have contributed to them, and it is no wonder that our enemies take no care to remedy our faults, and that they joyn with us to do us harm. But hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, not that we throw the helve after the hatchet, and ſet our houſe on fire our ſelves, becauſe others are reſolved to burn it, or take in hand to remedy particular loſſes by means weak to redreſs them, but strong and certain to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine the general. God, who hath ſo many times diverted the counſels taken for our ruine, hath neither lost his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor altered his will. We ſhall find him the ſame still, if we have the grace to wait for his aſſistance, not caſting our ſelves headlong by our impatience, or ſetting our mind obſtinately upon impoſſibilities. Take this for certain, that although our enemies ſeek our ruine, they will never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it openly, without ſome pretence, other and better then that of Religion, which we muſt not give them. For if we keep our ſelves in the obedience which ſubjects owe to their Sovereign, you ſhall ſee, that while our enemies hope in vain that we ſhall make our ſelves guilty by ſome diſobedience. God will give them ſome other work, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us occaſions to ſhew to his Majeſty that we are a body uſefull to this State, and put him in mind of the ſignal ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices that our Churches have done to the late King of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious memory. But if we are ſo unfortunate, that while we keep our ſelves in our duty, the calumnies of our enemies
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:204612:35"/>
prevail, at least we ſhall get this ſatisfaction, that we have kept all the right on our ſide, and made it appear, that we love the peace of the State.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding all this, Gentlemen, you may and ought to take order for the ſafety of your perſons. For whereas his Majeſty and his Counſel have ſaid often, that if you ſeparate your ſelves, he will let our Churches enjoy peace, and the benefit of his Edicts, it is not reaſonable that your ſeparation be done with the peril of your perſons. And whenever you petition for your ſafe diſſolution, I truſt it will be eaſily obtained, if you make poſſible requests, and ſuch, as the miſery of the time, and the preſent neceſſity can bear. In the mean while you may adviſe before you part, what ſhould be done, if notwithſtanding your ſeparation, we ſhould be oppreſt, that order your prudence may finde, and it is not my part to ſuggeſt it unto you.</p>
                     <p>If by propounding theſe things unto you, I have exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the limits of diſcretion, you will be pleaſed to impute it to my zeal for the good and preſervation of the Church. And if this advice of mine is rejected, as unworthy of your conſideration, this comfort I ſhall have, that I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged my conſcience, and retiring my ſelf into ſome fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Countrey, there I will end thoſe few daies which I have yet to live, lamenting the loſs of the Church, and the deſtruction of the Temple, for the building whereof I have laboured with much more courage and fidelity then ſucceſs. The Lord turn away his wrath from us, direct your Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and preſerve your perſons. I reſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>When this Letter was read in the Aſſembly, ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe immediately and left it: others continued to ſit, and by their ſitting turned theſe warnings into prophecies. This Epiſtle will give to the judicious Reader an inſight into the affairs of that time and State; and together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the preſent queſtion, which is altogether of fact, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and how far the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants may be taxed of diſobedience againſt their Sovereign. For it is juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this relation, that when ſome of them reſiſted, they had the greateſt temptation to it that a juſt fear can preſent unto fleſh and bloud; and yet that even then they were diſavowed by the <hi>best and the moſt</hi> of their Church, and exhorted to their duty by their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, which in points of conſcience are the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive perſons of a party when they are ſolemnly met; and this was the ſenſe of the National Synod, of which this eminent Divine was Preſident but two moneths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

                  <hi>Bleſſed is he that conſiders with intelligence and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him that is in a low condition.</hi> It is eaſie for us that enjoy proſperity under a gracious King, to determine the point of paſſive obedience: not ſo for them that groan under the ſad burden of the Croſs. Chriſtian equity ought to pity thoſe that are expoſed to the ſad counſels of terrour and deſpair.</p>
               <p>I am not without ſuſpition, that when thoſe places of ſafety were granted to them by <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the Kings Counſel ſuggeſted or furthered that grant for their undoing in the time to come; for they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:204612:36"/>
might well foreſee, that on the one ſide a wiſe King would not ſuffer long ſuch a diſeaſe in his own bowels as a party of his ſubjects armed with places of ſecurity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: and that on the other ſide, the party ſo ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, would not part with that ſecurity for their Religion, Liberties, and Lives, without committing ſuch actions as would make them obnoxious to their Sovereigns an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and their ruine.</p>
               <p>Three or four years after the rendition of all thoſe places to the King, the Duke of <hi>Montmorancy</hi> raiſed a party againſt him in <hi>Languedock,</hi> of which he was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, hoping to find the Proteſtants which are nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous there, prepared ſubjects for an inſurrection; yet neither his ſolicitations, nor the reſentment of their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings could move them to aſſiſt him. But they joyned u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally with the King, and did rare ſervice in a battel where that Duke was defeated and taken, and with him a Jeſuited Biſhop. And it is to be noted, that old Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>de la Force</hi> a Proteſtant, that hardly eſcaped the Maſſacre of St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> was one of the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of the Kings Army.</p>
               <p>The Adverſary gives a touch of the wars, begun in <hi>Germany, Bohemia,</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi> in the year 1619. of which he imputes the whole cauſe to the Proteſtants. I undertake not to juſtifie their errours; I ſay onely, that whoſo had looked with an ordinary judgement upon the face of thoſe Countreys, as they were then divided and ballanced between the Papiſt and the Proteſtant party, might have foretold without a ſpirit of prophecy, that they ſhould not enjoy a long peace, there being ſo many free ſpirits animated to liberty and revenge by the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:204612:36"/>
of the ſuperſtitious houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> towards their Proteſtant ſubjects.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> was a prodigious man, and a <hi>demi-Turk,</hi> as this man makes him, it is nothing to us: as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion juſtifieth no mans faults, no mans faults can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Religion. The notion under which I fancy that man, is, that of a cannon-ſhot without bullet, which makes a great and ſhort crack, and no effect. All that the Adverſary ſaith of his dealing with the <hi>Turk,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the Proteſtants of <hi>Hungary</hi> were ſo oppreſt by the Emperour, that they wiſht themſelves the <hi>Turks</hi> ſubjects. I pray God they do not ſo ſtill, and with them the other Proteſtants belonging to the Emperours here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Countreys, ſeeing their brethren that live under the <hi>Turk</hi> enjoy the freedome of their Religion. The ſame reaſon might make the Proteſtants of the Empire slow to contribute towards the war againſt the <hi>Turk;</hi> yet I hear they are as forward as any. It is not declaiming againſt them (as the Adverſary doth) but uſing them like Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that will make them joyn heartily with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in that war. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> branch of the houſe of <hi>Austria</hi> hath loſt great part of <hi>Netherlands</hi> by the inflexibleneſs of <hi>Philip</hi> the II. of <hi>Spain,</hi> to grant liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Religion to his Proteſtant ſubjects. Let the <hi>German</hi> branch of <hi>Austria</hi> which uſeth the like hardneſs, take heed of the like loſs.</p>
               <p>The Reformation of Religion in the United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is that upon which the Adverſary triumpheth moſt, it being very apparent, to his thinking, that they brought it in by ſhaking the Yoke of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> But there is great difference between reforming
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:204612:37"/>
and eſtabliſhing the Reformation. The firſt was done by the Word, the ſecond by the Sword, and the firſt forty years before the ſecond. The Reformed Religion was ſpred over the Seventeen Provinces many years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was any thought of making an Union againſt the Spaniard; neither was that Union made upon the ſcore of Religion, but of State, for maintaining their Franchiſes againſt the oppreſſion of <hi>Spain;</hi> as it was ſufficiently juſtified, by their chooſing of <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Alenſon,</hi> a Roman Catholick, for their Prince;<note place="margin">An. 1583.</note> which they would never have done, if the Union <hi>had ever marched under the notion of Religion,</hi> as our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary<note place="margin">pag. 32.</note> affirmeth, or if the Proteſtants had been the greater number. And that Religion was not that which knit the party, and that there was no ſuch thing in the Articles, it appeared again when ſome Provinces for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook the Union, becauſe the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had put Religion among the cauſes of their defenſive Warre. If then the Union was unjuſt, the injuſtice muſt not be caſt upon Religion, ſince it was not made upon that intereſt; and if it was juſt, it could not become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, by the acceſſion of the intereſt of Religion, to the other intereſts. So that which way ſoever the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary takes it, the Roman Catholicks bear an equal ſhare with the Proteſtants, in the right and wrong of the cauſe; <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant</hi> were as guilty as <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Zealand:</hi> The difference is, that <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant</hi> were beaten to obedience by the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> but <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> proved too ſtrong for him. The World beholds with amazement the ſucceſſe of that Union, that theſe little Provinces ſhould bring

their Prince to be their ſuppliant, that he might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to quit his right over them, and acknowledge them Free States, yea and to juſtifie their armes. It is that ſucceſſe, not their guilt, that makes our Adverſary ſo vehement againſt them; for ill Gameſters will be angry, when they are looſers.</p>
               <p>Whether it be out of wilfulneſſe or ignorance, this Gentleman miſ-repreſents that buſineſſe, ſpeaking of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as of an abſolute Sovereigne of the Low Countries, and of the people, as of meer Subjects. <hi>Philip</hi> the II. was not their <hi>King,</hi> but their <hi>Count.</hi> But<note place="margin">I have ſaid ſomething of that in my <hi>Clamor Regii San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinis ad Caelum.</hi>
                  </note> it is beſides my buſineſſe, to inquire how the rights of Sovereignty were divided between the Prince and the People, which ought to be known before the caſe be ſtated.</p>
               <p>If the cauſe of Religion made the quarrel irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable, <hi>Philip</hi> the II. may thank himſelf for it. <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> the great friend of the Spaniard, tells us that the Great Council of <hi>Spain</hi> repreſented to the King, that unleſſe he granted liberty of conſcience to his Subjects of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> the Countrey would be loſt, and the Warre perpetual; whereupon the King fell on his knees before a Crucifix, and vowed that he would chooſe to loſe his Dominions, rather then to permit hereſie, ſo he called the Proteſtant Religion. If many years after they were offered to be ſecured for their Religion, as our Adverſary ſaith (which I never heard before) it was<note place="margin">pag. 39.</note> too late. It is an unequitable motion, and more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous for the Roman party than ours, that exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes happening by the ordinary courſe of humane buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes be not imputed to Religion. Oppreſſion will
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:204612:38"/>
make ſubjects to ſhake off the yoke: And the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their defection keeps them from returning to their former ſubjection.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Holland</hi> the Adverſary ſaileth into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and objects to us the Maxims of <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Buchanan,</hi> and the diſorders of that time. Of which I have ſaid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the Chapter before.</p>
               <p>Of the Work of Reformation in <hi>England,</hi> and the publick actions of that age upon that intereſt, he ſpeaks very ſcornfully; ſaying, that the <hi>Sect of Wicleff lay</hi>

                  <hi>ſtrangled in the cradle till King</hi> Edward <hi>the VI. his dayes, when ſome ends of it were taken up again, and ſet out with more oſtentation then ever, in that Princes minority: and what rare effects of obedience were by that means produced in Queen</hi> Maries <hi>time, who brought them up again to the test, may be eaſily read in our Chronicles. Wherein it is plain, that in the poor five years of her Reign there was</hi> de facto <hi>more open and violent oppoſition and rebellion, made by her own ſubjects, then Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>had in forty five years; or any Prince before or ſince the Wicleffian doctrine, till the ſame ſmothered fire broke out at laſt in good King</hi> Charles <hi>his time, to his utter ruin, and the ſhaking of the very foundation of his Monarchy.</hi> Is this ſpoken like <hi>a most obſervant Son, and in every honeſt mans eſteem a pious, reverend, and learned Prieſt of the Church of England,</hi> as this Author is tearmed in the Publiſhers Epiſtle to the Reader? Certainly a Son and a Prieſt of the Church of <hi>England</hi> would never have derived from <hi>Wickleff,</hi> but from the Holy Scripture, the Religion of the Church his Mother; nor aſcribed to her Religion the cauſe of the late horrid rebellion. We ſee
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:204612:38"/>
what a Son and Prieſt of the Church he is, the tree is known by his fruit. What better figs can be gathered from ſuch a thorn? What better grapes from ſuch a bramble? And what is that doctrine of <hi>Wickliffe</hi> which he imputes to the Proteſtants, to the Engliſh eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? <hi>Impios nullum dominium habere, That the ungodly</hi>

                  <hi>can have no right of dominion:</hi> Was that the doctrine <hi>ſet out with oſtentation in</hi> Edward <hi>the VI. his dayes?</hi> Or was any of the Proteſtants found tainted with that doctrine, when Queen <hi>Mary</hi> burnt them, which this man calls <hi>bringing them to the teſt?</hi> Sure it was not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ground that ſome oppoſitions were made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Queen. It is a wonder that ſhe met with no more, conſidering how her Father had declared by Act of Parliament her Mothers Marriage unlawful, and her ſelf incapable of the Crown, and had miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably incumbred the Title and Succeſſion of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>That there was <hi>more open and violent oppoſition</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her in her five years reigne from her own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, then Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had in forty five years, it is, becauſe they that went to queſtion her Title, went to work plainly above boord; but no ſecret Jeſuitical conſpiracies to ſtabbe or poyſon her, as againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The means ſhe made to reduce her diſſenting ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in Religion, when they made no oppoſition againſt her, was to make bon-fires of them. Three hundred of thoſe burnt-offerings ſhe ſacrificed unto God: A farre greater number in <hi>her poor five years,</hi> then that of the Popiſh Martyrs of diſobedience, ſince the death of that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:204612:39"/>
Queen, now above a hundred years. For no Papiſt was executed for his Religion, all for diſobeying the Laws of the Land, and many of them for High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>It is known that Queen <hi>Mary</hi> got the Crowne by the aſſiſtance of the Proteſtants of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence ſhe gave them for it. And, whereas no fewer then eight rebellions did riſe in <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. his dayes, I find not that the Proteſtants had a hand in any of them. All were raiſed by Papiſts; and upon the ſcore of Popery.</p>
               <p>The principal colour of our Adverſaries malice is his deteſtation of the late rebellion of <hi>England,</hi> and the execrable Murther committed in the ſacred Perſon of our gracious Sovereigne. Upon this he makes ſeveral Panegyricks, which are very ill ſorted with his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for <hi>Mariana,</hi> and juſtifying of the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> doctrine: Eſpecially ſeeing that thoſe actions were copied out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their principles. <hi>Felicia tempora quae te Moribus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morunt.</hi> Belike the curious pens of the wiſe States-men and learned Scholars of <hi>England,</hi> had need to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the boyiſh theames of a petty Novice of <hi>Doway,</hi> to learn the duty of Subjects, and to abhorre the guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of rebellion.</p>
               <p>The venome that lieth under that oratory of inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives, is that all the miſchief is imputed to the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants of Integrity,</hi> a term which he uſeth like a ſtirrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leather, longer or ſhorter, according to his occaſions, yet alwayes treacherouſly to caſt the faults of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon, or ſome heretical Sect upon the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the Proteſtants. But let him know, that the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:204612:39"/>
King, the Church, and the State, are <hi>Proteſtants of Integrity:</hi> and that the parricides and troublers of our <hi>Iſrael</hi> will never give him thanks for calling them <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants:</hi> Alſo that we acknowledge them not for ſuch, unleſſe it be upon a new ſcore, becauſe they <hi>proteſt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Kings power and the duty of their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>When Jeſuits or their Scholars, (as this Gentleman is) charge our Fanaticks with High Treaſon, they do but act that which they had prepared to do, if the Powder-Plot had taken. For they had a Declaration ready to indite the Proteſtants of that Treaſon. For theſe men would ſtory the juſt clamor againſt them for their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of rebellion and parricide, by laying the ſame charge with loud words upon others.</p>
               <p>We have great reaſon to call upon the Juſtice of God and Men to condemne the unſincerity of this cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. With what face or conſcience can the Jeſuits paſſe a hard Sentence upon the late Rebels and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>killers, ſeeing that theſe furious Zealots have neither taught nor done any thing in that horrible defection, but what they had learned of the Jeſuits?

committed in many ages, the Pope commanded all the papers about that queſtion to be gathered and burnt: In obedience to which order, a Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick in <hi>Paris</hi> was demanded a Copy which he had of thoſe papers; but the Gentleman who had had time to conſider and deteſt the wickedneſſe of that project, refuſed to give it, and ſhewed it to a Proteſtant friend of his; and related to him the whole carriage of this negotiation, with great abhorrency of the practices of the Jeſuites.</p>
               <p>In purſuance of that Order from <hi>Rome,</hi> for the pulling down both the Monarch and the Monarchy of <hi>England,</hi> many Jeſuites came over, who took ſeveral ſhapes, to go about their worke, but moſt of them took party in the Army. About thirty of them were met by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Gentleman, between <hi>Roan</hi> and <hi>Diepe,</hi> to whom they ſaid (taking him for one of their party) that they were going into <hi>England,</hi> and would take Armes in the Independant Army, and endeavour to be Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators.</p>
               <p>A Proteſtant Lady living in <hi>Paris</hi> in the time of our late calamities, was perſwaded by a Jeſuit going in ſcarlet, to turn Roman Catholick: When the diſmal newes of the Kings Murther came to <hi>Paris,</hi> this Lady, as all other good Engliſh Subjects, was moſt deeply afflicted with it. And when this Scarlet Divine came to ſee her, and found her melting in tears, about that heavy and common diſaſter; he told her with a ſmiling countenance, that ſhe had no reaſon to lament, but rather to rejoyce, ſeeing that the Catholicks were rid of their greateſt enemy, and that the Catholick Cauſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:204612:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was much furthered by his death. Upon which the Lady in great anger put the man down the ſtairs: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, If that be your Religion, I have done with you for ever. And God hath given her the grace to make her word good hitherto.</p>
               <p>Many intelligent Travellers can tell of the great joy among the Engliſh Convents and Seminaries, about the Kings death, as having overcome their enemy, and done their main work for their ſettlement in <hi>England;</hi> of which they made themſelves ſo ſure, that the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictins</hi> were in great care that the Jeſuites ſhould not get their land: and the Engliſh Nunnes were contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who ſhould be Abbeſſes in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An underſtanding Gentleman viſiting the Engliſh Friars of <hi>Dunkirke,</hi> put them upon the diſcourſe of the Kings death, and to pump out their ſenſe about it, ſaid that the Jeſuites had laboured very much, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe that great work: To which they anſwered, that the Jeſuites would engroſſe to themſelves the glory of all great and good works, and of this among others workes; whereas they had laboured as diligently and effectually for it as they. So there was ſtriving for the glory of that atchievement, and the Friars ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as much Jeſuited as the Jeſuites.</p>
               <p>In the height of <hi>Olivers</hi> Tyranny, <hi>Thomas White</hi> Gentleman, a Prieſt, and a right Jeſuite in all his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples about obedience, ſet out a Book entituled, the <hi>Grounds of Obedience and Government:</hi> Wherein he<note place="margin">pag. 122.</note> maintains that, <hi>If the people by any circumſtance be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved to the State of Anarchy, their promiſe made</hi> (to their expelled Governour) <hi>binds no more.

ſaid of <hi>Goliah</hi>'s ſword, <hi>There is none like that, give it me:</hi> In this Combate the enemies ſword is the right weapon, none like it. The Adverſary to diſgrace our Doctrine, hath objected to us ſome paſſages of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, moſt of them falſe or wreſted, and ſome actions of perſons of the Proteſtant party. But though he had proved all theſe to be true, he had done no harm to our Doctrine, which is not built upon private opinions, or upon private or publick actions. He ſhould have taken our Confeſſions in hand, and Indicted them of rebellious Tenets, if he could have found any: Or finding none, he ſhould have given glory to God, and confeſſed the Truth of God with us.</p>
               <p>But if I bring him the Bulls of his Popes, and their Decrees, can he ſcape as we do, when he urgeth us with maxims of <hi>Buchanan</hi> or <hi>Goodman?</hi> Can he ſay, <hi>The Pope ſpeaks Treaſon, and preſcribes Rebellion,</hi> as we ſay of theſe men; and <hi>my faith is not tyed to his authority?</hi> Can he as freely go off from the Popes judgement, as we do from the beſt of our party, when their Tenet is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to us aberring from the rule of Gods Word, and diſſenting from the Articles of Religion, conſented unto by the Provincial Convocations of the Church? We will then object to him and his party that which they cannot diſown, unleſs they diſown their Faith and Religion, ſince their Faith and Religion depend upon the Popes Decrees; and that ſo ſtrongly, and with ſuch a ſpirit of deluſion, that the moſt peſtilent opinions paſs with them for Evangelical Truths, and the moſt abominable actions for patterns of Holineſs, if they be once marked with that ſtamp; according to <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>

But the Popes that reigned two or three hundred yeers ago, made that power of depoſing Princes, as ancient as they could by their Hiſtorians.</p>
               <p>The ſame muſt be ſaid of the pretended depoſition of <hi>Chilperick</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> by Pope <hi>Zachary,</hi> the next Succeſſor of <hi>Gregory</hi> the III. Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> ſets forth that example to fright Kings, in his Oration before the three States of <hi>France,</hi> and ſaith that the Pope abſolved the people of <hi>France</hi> from their Allegiance to that King, for which he alledgeth the teſtimony of two new Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> and <hi>Du Tillet.</hi> But <hi>Ado</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Vienna</hi> in his Chronicle ſaith, <hi>That the French by the counſel of Embaſſadors, and of Pope</hi> Zachary, <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> Pepin <hi>their King.</hi> And <hi>Trithemius</hi> in his <hi>Abridgement of Annals</hi> ſpeaks thus: Chilperick <hi>King of the French, is put out from the Kingdome, as incapable to reigne, by the common conſent of the great perſons of the Kingdome, Pope</hi> Zachary <hi>giving them counſel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But although the Champions of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> aſcribe to theſe ancient Popes that power which they never exerciſed or pretended to.

                  <hi>Benedict</hi> the XI. who was elected in his place, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved <hi>Philip</hi> preſently.

               <p>Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> XXIII. angry that <hi>Ludovicus Bavarus</hi> had taken upon him the adminiſtration of the Empire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Platina Hierony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</note> he got his leave, refuſed to crown him, though many times deſired by him.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:204612:59"/>
then ſitting at <hi>Avignon</hi>) was crowned by the joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Clergy, Nobles, and People. Upon which he was excommunicated and deprived of the Empire as far as words could do it, by this Pope. And the ſame Sentence was confirmed againſt the Emperour, by the Succeſſor of <hi>Iohn, Benedict</hi> the XII.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clement</hi> the VI. who came next after, was more <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clement</hi> then his predeceſſors, in perſecuting <hi>Ludovicus Bavarus.</hi> For he excommunicated all the Biſhops that<note place="margin">Nauclerus.</note> adhered to him; and ſet Bulls at the doors of all the Churches, to raiſe rebellion againſt him. And when the Emperour would ſubmit to him, and ſue for peace, he required ſuch conditions of him, as neither he, nor the Princes of the Empire, would or could yield unto, as that he ſhould depoſe himſelf, put all his Eſtate, and his own Sons in the Popes power, and promiſe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake no more any thing, without the Popes leave. Theſe conditions being rejected by the Emperour, <hi>Clement</hi> charged the Electors to elect another. Which when the Archbiſhop of <hi>Ments</hi> refuſed to do, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Emperours innocency, he deprived him of his Archbiſhoprick, and of his Electoral dignity. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Electors corrupted with money by <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> elected his Son <hi>Charles</hi> King of the Romans, whom <hi>Clement</hi> approved; whence great and bloody Warres followed, and the Emperour <hi>Ludovicus Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> was taken away by poyſon by <hi>Clements</hi> means, as ſome Authors write.</p>
               <p>That Election of <hi>Charles</hi> the IV. was the breaking<note place="margin">Faſciculus temp. Volatterran</note> of the back of the Empire, which the Popes had been long labouring for. For this <hi>Charles,</hi> that he might be
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:204612:59"/>
elected Emperour, pawned the tributes of the Empire to the Electors. And the Electors made him ſwear that he would never diſengage that pawne. Then they made him make that authentical Capitulation, which I have produced in my firſt Chapter. The Empire being thus weakned, and loſing the Tributes, which are the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes of Warre, was diſabled from reſiſting the Turk, who hath ſince waſted the Chriſtian Provinces with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle oppoſition, and hath deſtroyed ſo many Churches, or turned them into Moskites. For all theſe diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Church and the Empire may thank the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> which had a hand in all the Negotiations of the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> and whoſe Authority acted alwayes for the depreſſion of the Emperour. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could all theſe conditions, ſo hurtful to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Dignity, and the publick ſubſiſtence, have paſt into ſtanding laws, if the Pope had not promoted them, or if he would have ſhewed himſelf againſt them.</p>
               <p>Since this Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the VI. for about fifty or threeſcore years, I find not that the Popes had many irons in the fire out of the limits of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Papal power being much broken with Schiſmes. So that the Popes inſtead of fulminating Bulls againſt Emperours and Kings, courted its ſeveral Monarchs of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to take their party againſt their Anti-popes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Benedict</hi> the XIII. in the year 1408. being incenſed<note place="margin">Theodoricus à Niem in nemore uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis.</note> againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the VI. of <hi>France,</hi> for inhibiting the exactions of the Papal Court, ſent a Bull of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication againſt the King and his Princes.

                  </note> of <hi>Paris</hi> required that the Bull ſhould be torne,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:204612:60"/>
and that Pope <hi>Benedict,</hi> (whom they called <hi>Peter de Luna</hi>) ſhould be declared Heretick, Schiſmatick, and diſturber of peace: Which was done. The Bull was torne by Sentence of the Court. And two <hi>Bulliſts,</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Carolus Molinaeus contra par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas datas,</hi> relates that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Court.</note> of that Bull, made that which they call <hi>Honourable amends,</hi> upon the Pallace ſtairs, then were carried in two dung carts, arrayed in Jerkins of courſe linnen cloth painted, with paper Miters on their head, the trumpets ſounding before them, and the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple howting upon them, and abuſing them. So little account did they make of the roaring of the Popes Bulls.</p>
               <p>For a hundred years after <hi>Benedict</hi> the XIII. I find not that the Popes made uſe of their ſpiritual Sword againſt any Prince out of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Sicily;</hi> partly by reaſon of Schiſmes, when that Roman Beaſt had many heads; partly by reaſon of the Councils occaſioned by theſe Schiſmes. For they had three Councils in leſſe than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> at <hi>Baſil,</hi> and at <hi>Florence;</hi> and the firſt and ſecond of them took upon them to depoſe Popes, and gave credit to that dangerous opinion, ſo odious to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Council is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Pope. This kept the Popes for a time in ſome order and reſpect to the Princes of Chriſtendome, but for ſome wrangling about pragmatick ſanctions, which grew not ſo high as to Warre or Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>But in recompence, <hi>Julius</hi> the II. raiſed warres and tumults, as much as would ſerve for a hundred years. He drew both his Swords againſt ſeveral Princes and States of Chriſtendome; eſpecially againſt that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

So much blood was ſhed in Chriſtendome by the meanes of that plague of mankind Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the II. that it is thought that he was the death of two hundred thouſand Chriſtians, in ſeven years time.</p>
               <p>In a Synod of the Gallican Church at <hi>Tours,</hi> it was<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nicol.

               <p>We cannot charge the Succeſſor of <hi>Iulins, Leo</hi> the X. to have ſtirred Wars abroad; he loved too much his eaſe at home for that.

               <p>After him came next but one <hi>Clement</hi> the VII. the Fomenter of the quarrell between the Emperour and the French, joyning ſometimes to the one, ſometimes to the other, and playing falſe with both, whereby he gave occaſion to the taking and ſacking of <hi>Rome.</hi> The thundering of this Pope, and of his Succeſſor<note place="margin">Iovius.</note>

               </p>
               <p>This Bull was the fire and the roaring of the Canon, and the bullet came forth immediately; which was the rebellion in the <hi>North,</hi> for which <hi>Chapino Vitelli</hi> was ſent into <hi>England</hi> from the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> under pretence of compounding ſome controverſies about commerce. And <hi>Nicholas Morton</hi> was ſent from the Pope to knit the rebellion. Which he did, denouncing from his Maſter, that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and thereby had forfeited to the Pope all her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and power. At the ſame time a rebellion broke out in <hi>Ireland,</hi> kindled or blown by a Spaniard, <hi>Iuan Mendoza.</hi> And when the Rebells of <hi>England</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, they found refuge among the Papiſt Rebells of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who ſet up again the Engliſh rebellion. All theſe in vain, by the gracious aſſiſtance of God to poor <hi>England,</hi> as if his compaſſion had been ſtirred up by his jealouſie, after that the Pope had declared himſelf ſo inſolently, <hi>Prince over all People, and all Kingdoms, to pluck up, destroy, ſcatter, conſume, plant, and build.</hi> And

               <p>Neither did <hi>Pius</hi> the V. fight onely by Bulls, but at the ſame time that the Bull was publiſhed, he laid down a hundred thouſand Crowns to raiſe the rebellion, and promiſed fifty thouſand more, yea, and to bear the whole charge of the War. That money was diſtributed by one <hi>Ridolpho.</hi> And how active that Pope was to ſtirre <hi>Spain, France,</hi> and <hi>Netherlands</hi> againſt the Queen, and to put her Kingdome in combuſtion, is related by <hi>Hieronymo Catena,</hi> an Authour of great credit at <hi>Rome</hi> in his life of <hi>Pius</hi> the V.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> the XIII. ſucceeded <hi>Pius</hi> the V. in all his plots againſt <hi>England.</hi> He gave to <hi>Thomas Stukely,</hi> an Engliſh Rebell, a Commiſſion to help the Rebells of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and get that Kingdome for the Baſtard-Son of his Holineſs, <hi>Iames Boncompagnon;</hi> and gave him the command of eight hundred Italians to joyn with King <hi>Sebastian</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who had engaged his word to the Pope to ſerve him with his whole power againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and had raiſed a great Army for that expedition. But when <hi>Stukely</hi> came to <hi>Sebastian,</hi> he found him poſſeſs'd with a new project to help a Moor King of <hi>Fez,</hi> againſt another King who kept him out of poſſeſſion, and to get the Kingdome from them both. To that War he invited <hi>Stukely,</hi> promiſing that preſently after that work done (which he repreſented to him moſt eaſie) they ſhould go together to the War againſt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> So they ſailed over into <hi>Africa,</hi> where <hi>Sebastian</hi> and his whole Army were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:204612:63"/>
and with him <hi>Stukely</hi> and the Popes Italian Souldiers were cut in pieces. A deliverance of <hi>England</hi> ever to be remembred with praiſe and admiration. <hi>So let thine enemies periſh, O Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Pope had a great hand in that unparallelled villany wrought by the marriage of <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varra,</hi> with the Siſter of <hi>Charles</hi> the IX. of <hi>France.</hi> A marriage which <hi>Pius</hi> the V. would never conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by reaſon of their difference in Religion. But when his Succeſſor <hi>Gregory</hi> the XIII. was told by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> that this marriage was intended as a trap to deſtroy <hi>Henry</hi> and his Proteſtant party, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently gave his diſpenſation for the celebrating of it, and encouraged the deſign. The horrible maſſacre which attended the jollity of that marriage, was received at<note place="margin">Thuanus.</note> 
                  <hi>Rome</hi> with triumphant expreſſions of publick joy. And Cardinal <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin</hi> was ſent Legat into <hi>France,</hi> to praiſe the Kings piety and wiſdom in that great action, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow bleſſings and ſpiritual graces upon the King and the Actors of that fearful Tragedy. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> might well praiſe what themſelves had procured, if not contrived; and truly the plot hath an Italian garb, and looks not like a production of the French ſoil.</p>
               <p>Not long after this Pope ſent to <hi>Henry</hi> the III. of <hi>France</hi> and to his people Indulgences for millions of years, which were to be obtained by making proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to four Churches in <hi>Paris,</hi> and by being zealous and diligent in the extirpation of hereſies, that is (in his ſtyle) to extermine the Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>The male line of the Kings of <hi>Portugal</hi> being extinct,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:204612:63"/>
this Pope laid a claim to the Kingdome, as depending from the holy See, and would have the Nation to have taken Arms for him againſt the heirs from the females: But his claim was hiſſed out with great ſcorn.</p>
               <p>In the year 1580. this Pope ſent an Italian called <hi>San Ioſepho</hi> with ſome Italian Troops into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to joyn with the Iriſh Rebells. When they were demanded by a meſſage from the Lord Deputy who they were, and what they came for, they anſwered, Some that they were ſent by the moſt holy Father the Pope, and ſome from the Catholick King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to whom the Pope had given <hi>Ireland,</hi> becauſe Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had juſtly forfeited her Title to <hi>Ireland</hi> by her hereſie. A doctrine which at the ſame time was preach'd in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> by Jeſuites and other Seminary Prieſts; with great boldneſs and vehemency: till the Queen and her Councell perceiving what danger the State was running into by theſe mens activeneſs and impunity, <hi>Campian</hi> and ſome others ſent by the Pope on that errand were apprehended. And being examined, they obſtinately defended the Popes authority over the Queen, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that ſhe was no Queen, as being lawfully depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Pope; upon which they were condemned and executed. That Crown of Martyrdom the Pope procured to his Confeſſors. And the greater the number is of thoſe Martyrs that the Papiſts muſter, the more they exaggerate the Popes cruelty to his trueſt Vaſſalls. For could the Pope expect, that perſons ſent to perſwade the people to diſpoſſeſs and kill their Sovereign, ſhould have other dealing from the hand of Juſtice.</p>

that which <hi>Pius</hi> the V. ſets forth in his Bull againſt the Queen, that <hi>God hath made the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>Prince over all people and all Kingdoms.</hi> But the Engliſh Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts are taught that beſides that general right over all Kingdomes, the Pope hath a peculiar right over <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> as his proper Dominions. This is <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmins</hi> doctrine which he hath made bold to maintain unto King <hi>James</hi> himſelf. <hi>The King</hi>

                  <hi>of</hi> England (ſaith he) <hi>is ſubject to the Pope by double right.

The other proper, by a right dominion.</hi> Then he pleadeth that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are the Churches dominions, the Pope the direct Lord, and the King his Vaſſal. This then being become an Article of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in which the Engliſh Papiſts are inſtructed; and this in conſequence, that if the Pope diſallow the King, he is no more King of <hi>England,</hi> but an Uſurper, and muſt be uſed accordingly: Let any man judge, who hath ſome equity and freedome of judgement left, whether a prudent Prince and Council of State, ought to ſuffer ſuch an inſtruction to be given to the people. Truly the more Religion is pretended for that doctrine, and the practice of Rebellion obtruded as a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Church, the more it concernes the loyal Magiſtrate to oppoſe it vigorously.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the V. to favour the enterpriſe of <hi>Philip</hi> the II. upon <hi>England,</hi> renewed the Excommunication
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:204612:64"/>
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> pronounced by <hi>Pius</hi> the V. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived her (<hi>verbo tenus</hi>) of her Kingdome, abſolved her ſubjects from all Allegiance to her, and publiſhed a <hi>Croiſada</hi> againſt her, as againſt the Turk, giving ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Indulgence to all that would make warre againſt her. But the Popes Curſes provoked Gods bleſſings upon the Queen, who might ſay as <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei</hi> curſed him; <hi>The Lord will requite me good for his curſing this day.</hi> All the ſtorms raiſed againſt <hi>England,</hi> were blown over without harme. The great preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Spain</hi> ſerved onely to diſable it, and ſecure <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And the many attempts againſt the Queens life upon that Bull, contributed to her ſafety, by manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the World the wickedneſſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the pernicious effects of the Roman principles. For which I might produce the Examinations and Confeſſions of many that ſuffered for attempting to murther the Queen, but I will bring but one for all. <hi>William Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> acknowledged that <hi>he had promis'd at</hi> Rome <hi>to kill the Queen, about which he was most troubled in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, till he lighted upon Dr.</hi> Allens book, <hi>which taught that Princes excommunicate for hereſie, were to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of Kingdome and life: Which book</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently excite me to proſecute my attempt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Popes Excommunications had more effect in <hi>France,</hi> for after that he had excommunicated King <hi>Henry</hi> the III. and abſolved his ſubjects from all Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to him; in conſequence of that Bull many of the French rebelled againſt their King, and he wasslain upon that account, by a Dominican Friar. Which when this Pope heard, he commended the action
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:204612:65"/>
highly, in a full Conſiſtory at <hi>Rome,</hi> and forbad that any funeral rites ſhould be celebrated for him. Which fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rites (uſually celebrated at <hi>Rome</hi> for departed Princes) conſiſting moſt in prayer for their ſouls, it appeareth that his Holineſſe was not contented that he had slain that King by his Bull, but would alſo damne his ſoul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> the XIV. excommunicated by his Bulls <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. of <hi>France,</hi> forbidding all Peers, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Cities and Commons, to yield him obedience, and declaring him incapable of the Crown, as an Heretick and relapſe. But that Bull was by the Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then ſitting at <hi>Tours,</hi> condemned to be torn and burnt by the Hang-man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clement</hi> the VIII. did the ſame over again, and excommunicated <hi>Henry:</hi> The Bull was condemned as the other, to be burnt by the hand of the Hang-man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the effect of theſe Bulls appeared by the attempts againſt the Kings life, which ſoon after followed; firſt by a woman, next by <hi>Peter Barriere,</hi> and again by <hi>John Chaſtel;</hi> all denying him to be King, becauſe he was not abſolved by the Pope. Neither did the effects of theſe Bulls ceaſe, after that the King was abſolved by his Holineſſe: For by them the King got his death. <hi>Ravilliac</hi> who killed him, could alledge them when he was examined; and ſay that the King was an Heretick in his heart, and deſerved to be slain, as an enemy of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> the V. was as turbulent as his predeceſſors, as he ſhewed it in his inſolent and impertinent quarrel with the Venetians, becauſe they had ſtopt by Edict
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:204612:65"/>
the giving of Lands to the Church, whereby the State loſt many tributes and ſervices. He threatned them of Excommunication, if they did not recal that Law. And upon their maintaining of it, he excommunicated them, and put their State in Interdict. But it took no effect, for none of their Clergy would or durſt obey it; the Jeſuites onely excepted, who therefore were expelled out of their dominions. They condemned the Popes Bull by Edict, and forbad the bringing of it into their Territory, upon pain of hanging: Neither did they give any ſatisfaction to the Pope, when the buſineſſe came to an Arbitrement: but forced him to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to himſelf, and to come to their terms.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of this Popes reigne, was detected that Treaſon, not to be matcht in any age for cruelty and depth of villany, the Gunpowder-plot, to have deſtroyed in one blow the King, the Parliament, the Judges of the Land, and all the flowre and ſtrength of the Kingdome of <hi>England.</hi> This horrid Treaſon was the effect of the ſeveral Bulls of the Pope before the Reigne of our gracious King <hi>James</hi> of glorious memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; who coming into his Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> found it lying under a Papal Interdict; and himſelf excluded from the Crown, by a Bull ſent into <hi>England,</hi> a little before the death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whereby all that are not Roman Catholicks, are declared incapable of, and excluded from the Succeſſion: of which his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty complains in his Apology. And that Bull was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the Indictment of the Jeſuite <hi>Garnet,</hi> as the principal motive of the Gunpowder Treaſon.</p>
               <p>This gave occaſion to the Oath of Supremacy, ſet
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:204612:66"/>
forth by the King and his Parliament then ſitting, for the ſecurity of his Majeſties Life and Dignity; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is required of all to whom it is adminiſtred, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his Majeſty to be the lawful King of the Realmes of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that the Pope hath no right to depoſe him of his Kingdoms, or diſpenſe his Subjects from their obedience to him. Alſo that they abhorre as impious and heretical, this doctrine, That Princes excommunicated by the Pope, may juſtly be depoſed or slain by their owne Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>This Oath being preſented to the Roman Catholicks, ſome of them made no difficulty to take it, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Blackwell</hi> the Arch-prieſt.

And he injoyneth them to obſerve diligently the precepts contained in the Letters which</hi> Clement <hi>the VIII. his predeceſſor had written a little before to Mr.</hi> George <hi>Arch-priest of</hi> England. By which Letters all Princes of a Religion contrary to the Roman, are excluded from the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Letters whereby the Engliſh were exhorted to be Martyrs of the Popes Sovereignty in <hi>England,</hi> and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:204612:66"/>
to make it an Article of their faith, which they muſt ſigne with their blood, that the Pope hath power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Princes, and expoſe them to be expelled and ſlain by their own ſubjects, did not receive that entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he expected among the Engliſh of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: For ſome rejected them as ſuppoſititious, &amp; forged by the Hereticks, to draw perſecution upon them, and kindle their Kings wrath againſt them, he being already juſtly provoked to revenge by the late conſpiracy. The Pope hearing of this, ſends other, and more expreſs let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters<note place="margin">Dated <hi>Aug.</hi> 23. 1607.</note> into <hi>England,</hi> to expoſtulate with the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks; ſaying That <hi>he wondred at their doubting of the truth of the Apoſtolick letters, to diſpenſe themſelves upon that pretence from obeying his commandments: And therefore he declareth, That thoſe Letters were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by himſelf, not only</hi> motu proprio &amp; ex certa ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, <hi>by his own motion and certain knowledge, but alſo after a long and grave deliberation, enjoyning them again to obey thoſe Letters, becauſe ſuch is his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe letters which ſet up rebellion with a high hand, as an Article of the Roman Faith, were joyned letters of Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to <hi>Blackwell</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, wherein he chides him bitterly for taking the Oath, which under colour of modifications, had no other end, but to tranſport the Popes authority to a Succeſſor of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. And by the examples of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, he exhorteth him to defend the Popes pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, whom he calleth <hi>The Head of the Faith.</hi>

If you believe and will maintain it, you are not good ſubjects, but dangerous perſons in the State. If you deny faith and obedience to that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Decree, you are not good Roman Catholicks; for if you were, you would acknowledge the Pope <hi>the Head of the Faith,</hi> with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and that the Pope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre in his Canons, and that it is in the Popes power to make Articles of faith, according to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Now the Pope hath made this an Article of your faith, the denying of it an hereſie, and the reſiſting of it a crime puniſh'd in the perſons of Kings by the deprivation of Kingdom and life.</p>

               <p>After that the Popes have thus commanded and wrought rebellion by expreſs Decrees, and filled the Chriſtian world with fire and blood theſe five or ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, have the Jeſuites the face, when we object this againſt the <hi>Head of their Faith,</hi> to object unto us in exchange ſome paſſages out of books either falſe, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned by us, if true: And the defenſive Arms of a few perſons, living under the Croſs, and driven by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the brink of deſpair? The evil which men of our Religion have ſaid or done, we condemn freely and openly. Let the Romaniſts condemn alſo ſo many Decrees of the Popes which have been the Incentives of war, and brands of rebellion: But that they cannot, as long as they remain Papiſts, ſworn to approve all that the Pope ſaith or doth.</p>
               <p>The difference between the faults of the Pope and thoſe of Proteſtants about the point of obedience, is this; That diſobedience with us is a crime, but with him it is a Law.

of Kings, but the Pope ſets them on by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications, and after the murther committed, makes panegyricks on their praiſe.</p>
               <p>Can the Romaniſts produce among us a Prieſt that hath made himſelf a Temporal Prince by robbing his Maſter of his land, who hath kickt down the Emperors crown, trodden upon his neck with his foot, depoſed him from his Kingdom, made his ſon riſe in Arms againſt him, abſolved his ſubjects from their obedience, and given his Dominions to another; One that makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the abſolute diſpoſer of Kingdoms, and Maſter of the Univerſe? Such a Prieſt is no where to be found but at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this true account of ſo many Emperours and Kings depoſed and killed, and ſo much rebellion, ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and deſolation wrought in Chriſtendom by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal excommunications and factions; let the conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reader, who is not altogether ignorant in modern Hiſtory, judge what truth there is in our Adverſaries aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, That <hi>in this last Century of years there have been</hi>

                  <hi>letters</hi> [to the King] <hi>he gave him a deep wound above the bladder with a poyſoned knife which he hid in his hand. O admirable confidence of minde! O memorable action! by killing the King, he got to himſelf a great name,</hi> And in the ſame place he taxeth the Kings ſervants, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:204612:69"/>
killed that murtherer, of cruelty and barbarouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>The ſecond anſwer for <hi>Mariana</hi> is, That <hi>the queſtion was not for killing of Kings, but for killing of Tyrants.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">page 94.</note> This man ſhews himſelf a right ſcholar of the Jeſuites, for this is their diſtinction. But if a King depoſed by the Pope keeps his Kingdome in ſpight of him, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him no more a King, but a Tyrant. And whereas there are two ſorts of Tyrants, ſome by uſurpation, which they call <hi>Tyrannos in Titulo,</hi> Tyrants in the Title; ſome Tyrants by adminiſtration; the Jeſuites hold, That a lawful King when he is once depoſed by<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Suarez deſenſ. lib. 6. cap.</hi> 5. Incipit eſſe Tyrannus in Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulo quia non eſt legitimus Rex,</note> the Pope, <hi>begins to be a Tyrant in his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, becauſe he is no more a lawful King.</hi> And being thus become a Tyrant, it is by their doctrine lawful to kill him. Therefore <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. of <hi>France,</hi> whom no body durſt have called King at <hi>Rome</hi> before his abſolution, was ſo often aſſaulted by murtherers at that time, becauſe he was accounted a Tyrant as long as he reigned without the Popes approbation. Upon that account <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, That the<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarm. in Barklaium, cap.</hi> 3. Non permitto tibi (inquit Papa) ut regi non pareas, quod eſſet contra jus divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, ſed ſacio ut ille qui tibi Rex erat non ſit ſibi deinceps Rex.</note> Pope depoſing a King, doth not permit the people to diſobey their King, but he makes him that was their King, to be their King no more.</p>
               <p>The third anſwer is, that the whole order of Jeſuites diſavowes <hi>Marian</hi>'s poſition, and have categorically determined the contrary. But why then did the ſame General of the Jeſuites, who diſavowed it when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction was hanging over the head of his Order, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and licence it before? For the Book was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:204612:69"/>
by <hi>Aqua viva</hi> General of the Jeſuites, and <hi>Stephanus Hoyeda</hi> Viſitor of their Society in the Province of <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</hi> And theapprobation mentioneth that<note place="margin">Quippe approbatus prius à viris doctis &amp; gravibus ex eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem ordine.</note> other Jeſuites had approved it before.</p>
               <p>The Adverſary brings ſome allegations out of Books of Jeſuites that diſown that poſition, that it is lawful to attempt againſt the life of a Prince. The Jeſuite <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demono-Johannes</hi> had made thoſe allegations ready for him. He makes <hi>Tolet</hi> ſay in his <hi>Summary, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. that it is not lawful to attempt againſt the life of a Prince, though he never ſo much abuſe his Power, and that is flat hereſie to maintain the contrary.

                  <note place="margin">Thuanus</note> a Scholar of the Ieſuites, who hit him in the mouth, and ſtruck out one of his teeth, intending to have cut his throat. In his examination he confeſs'd that he being guilty of a great crime, was kept priſoner by the Ieſuites in the chamber of Meditations, where after they had long terrified his ſoul, they propounded to him a way to Ieſſen his torments in hell which he had deſerved by his crimes; and that was to kill the King, which the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable youth promiſed and attempted.</p>
               <p>Upon this the Colledge of the Ieſuites was ſearched, and many perſons ſeized on, among which was found a book in the praiſe of <hi>James Clement</hi> the murtherer of <hi>Henry</hi> the III. written by the Ieſuite <hi>Guignard,</hi> as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſs'd, containing many arguments and reaſons to prove that it was lawful and juſt to kill <hi>Henry</hi> the III. together with many inductions and incitements to make away his Succeſſor, who was <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. then reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Theams given to young Scholars, were found to be about killing of Tyrants, with praiſes of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and exhortations to it.

               <p>Ten years after, they returned from their exile, the ſame men, corrupting the youth, and working rebellion; till in the end they got what they would have, even the Kings heart, which they keep in their principal houſe <hi>la Fleſche,</hi> after he had been ſtabbed by <hi>Ravaillac,</hi> a wretch, who in his examination and confeſſion ſhewed ſufficiently by whoſe inſtructions he was perſwaded to that parricidial act, for he gave this reaſon why he did it, becauſe the King would make War unto God, in as<note place="margin">

the part which the Jeſuites had in it. By the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorial Act a Book of <hi>Mariana</hi> was cenſured; not that which approveth the murthering of Kings. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was not ſo unkind as to diſgrace a work which doth their work; but another Book which treats of Coynes. Certainly had they disliked that notorious Book condemned to the fire by the Court of Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> they would not have forgotten to cenſure it while they were in hand with <hi>Mariana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. was ſtricken, the Colledge of the Jeſuites was environed with a Guard, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate and the people looking upon them as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and Contrivers of high Treaſon. And preſently they were ſued by the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> as corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the youth, and teachers of treaſonable doctrine. <hi>Peter Marteliere</hi> a famous Advocate pleaded for the Univerſity, and maintained that in the Confeſſion of <hi>Ravaillac</hi> evident marks were found of the Doctrine of the Jeſuites. The Jeſuites were caſt, and commanded to ſhut up their Colledge, and not to teach Schollars any more. The Kings Councell required their expulſion, but they had friends about the Queen Regent, and were ſuffered to ſtay; and in time recovered alſo the liberty to teach.</p>
               <p>Five years before that Kings death, it was a famous Hiſtory how Father <hi>Cotton</hi> a Ieſuite and his Confeſſor<note place="margin">Thuanus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hiſt. lib. 123. ad an. 1604.</note> had written in a paper ſome queſtions which he had propounded to a Maid, who was ſaid to be poſſeſſed with a Devil who told ſtrange things.

               <p>Two years after this Monſieur <hi>de la Force,</hi> Vice-Roy of <hi>Bearn</hi> and <hi>Navarre,</hi> by the intelligences which he had from <hi>Spain,</hi> by reaſon of his neighbourhood unto it, was advertiſed that a <hi>Spaniard</hi> of ſuch a ſtature, of ſuch a hair, and in ſuch apparel, departed ſuch a day from <hi>Barcelona,</hi> to go into <hi>France</hi> with intendment to make away the King by poyſon or other means. This Spaniard came to <hi>Paris,</hi> and addreſs'd himſelf to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cotton,</hi> who brought him unto the King, and gave great commendations of him. A while after came the Letters of Monſieur <hi>de la Force,</hi> giving warning to his Majeſty againſt that Spaniard, with the foreſaid deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. The King ſhewed the Letters to Father <hi>Cotton,</hi> and commanded him to bring back again that Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard. But <hi>Cotton</hi> returning a good while after, told the King that he could not find the man, and that he was gone.</p>
               <p>Not a year before the Kings death, <hi>Cotton</hi> writ unto a Provincial of <hi>Spain,</hi> divers things which the King
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:204612:77"/>
had revealed unto him in confeſſion: Which treachery being diſcovered, <hi>Cotton</hi> was in diſgrace for ſix moneths, and then was forgiven. But he did not forgive the King, who was ſtabbed ſoon after. A few dayes after the young King being importuned by him, put him off with this gird, <hi>I will tell you nothing, for you will write it into</hi> Spain, <hi>as you did my Fathers Confeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Half a year after the Kings death the Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſeeing evidently, that the murther of the King, and that of his next Predeceſſor, were the productions of the doctrine of the Ieſuites, condemned the Book of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> againſt <hi>Barklay,</hi> as <hi>containing a falſe and execrable propoſition, which tends to the overthrowing of the Powers ordained and establiſhed by God, inciting Subjects to rebellion, and withdrawing them from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Princes, to plot againſt their Lives and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and trouble the publick peace and tranquillity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have ſpoken before of the Decree of the Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Santarel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> de Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſi &amp; Schiſmate</note> Faculty of <hi>Paris,</hi> againſt the Book of the Ieſuite <hi>Santarel,</hi> confirmed by the judgement of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in <hi>May</hi> 1626. The ſame Book had been condemned by the Court of Parliament of <hi>Paris Martii</hi> 13. of the ſame year to be burnt. And becauſe the Book was printed at <hi>Rome</hi> by permiſſion of the Superiours, and with the approbation of <hi>Mutins Viteleſcus</hi> General of the Ieſuites, and Maſter of the Sacred Palace, the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites of <hi>Paris</hi> were ſent for by the Court and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Whereas their General had approved that Book, and declared his opinion, that the contents of it were certain and good, whether they believed as he did.</hi> They anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>Since their General lived at</hi> Rome, <hi>he could
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:204612:77"/>
not but approve that which the Court of</hi> Rome <hi>approveth. What do you believe</hi> then? ſaid the Court; <hi>The clean contrary,</hi> ſaid the Ieſuites. <hi>And what ſhould ye do if you were at</hi> Rome? <hi>As they do at</hi> Rome, ſaid they. To which ſome of the Court anſwered, <hi>What then! Have theſe men one conſcience at</hi> Rome, <hi>and another at</hi> Paris? <hi>God keep us from ſuch Confeſſors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame Court ſent for Father <hi>Cotton,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to confute the Book of <hi>Santarell. Cotton</hi> being put to a ſad <hi>dilemma,</hi> either to offend the Pope his Maſter, and his General and the whole Society; or to anſwer an Indictment of high Treaſon, freed himſelf by a ſudden death, being in perfect health before; or ſome of his Society took that pains for him. It ſeems that the Court were more peremptory with him, then King <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. who ſhewed him once that Book of <hi>Mariana,</hi> which ſince was condemned to the fire, and commanded him to confute it. But he gave ſome ill excuſe to the King, who preſs'd him no further about it.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time that this great Prince was slain by the faction of the Ieſuites, the Prince of <hi>Tranſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> was in the ſame danger by them. So much is certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Letters of the Baron of <hi>Zerotin, May</hi> 2. 1610. that a Ieſuite perſwaded a Lord of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> in whoſe houſe he lived, to kill the Prince. But the Prince having diſcover'd the Plot, killed the Conſpiratours, and the Ieſuite the Author of the conſpiracy.</p>
               <p>This Jeſuite was taken tardy, and had not the luck of many of his Confreres, who frame the plots, and look ſtanding out of the reach of the blows, the acting of the deſperate attempts upon which they have caſt
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:204612:78"/>
others. Yet there was a Scottiſh Jeſuite of the Colledge of <hi>Clermont</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> his name <hi>Alexander Hayes,</hi> who was ſo zealous, as to wiſh openly, and that often, that King <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. would paſſe by his Colledge, that he might throw himſelf down upon him from the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and break his neck. But by that croſſe caper he might be ſure to break his own. For theſe words, and for teaching openly, that it was good to diſſemble and performe obedience in ſhew for a while, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by Sentence of the Court to perpetual baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and (if ever he returned) to be hanged without any other forme of arraignment.</p>
               <p>Now if from their feats in forreign Countries, we look to their doings in <hi>England,</hi> what troubles they have ſtirred, and what miſchiefs they have plotted continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally againſt this State, now above a hundred years. We are at a loſſe in that prodigious heap of iniquity. They have afforded matter to large Volumes of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the labour of the worthy writers, need not to be ſeconded by mine. And when the Jeſuite <hi>Eudemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no-Iohannes</hi> in his Apologetick for <hi>Garnet,</hi> would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe or deny the treaſons wrought under the pretence of a Catholick zeal, the truth of them was aſſerted by the R.

aſſiſted and prompted by Jeſuites, as the judicial exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations will juſtifie.</p>
               <p>And now we ſpeak of <hi>Babington</hi> and his aſſociates, I find two brothers <hi>Bellamy</hi>'s, both apprehended for hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them, after they were openly proclaimed traitors, in their houſe neer <hi>Harrowhill,</hi> where they were kept ten dayes, and clothed in ruſtical habits.

But it ſeems by his behaviour, that the crime of <hi>hiding and diſguiſing traitors</hi> runs in the blood: For what is his covering of the parricidial doctrine of Jeſuites with falfe conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but <hi>hiding and diſguiſing traitors;</hi> whoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is declared treaſonable by ſundry Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Let him take warning by the crime and the ill ſucceſſe of theſe men of his name, and apply to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that Sentence of <hi>Tully,</hi> which he miſapplyeth to the Proteſtants of Integrity. <hi>Mirror te Antoni quorum facta imitere corum exitus non pertimeſcere.</hi> Since you imitate the actions of men of your name, <hi>Sir Bellamy,</hi> I wonder you are not frighted, with thinking of their ends.</p>
               <p>The Devil and the Jeſuites having been ſo often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of their attempts againſt <hi>England,</hi> in the end contrived the fouleſt plot that ingenious cruelty did in any age imagine; the Gunpowder-Treaſon, which ſhall be to the Worlds end, the wonder of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding

It is eaſie to judge that the plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of it had been bred long in another Climate then the middle aire of <hi>England;</hi> for it looks like one of the feats of <hi>Caeſar Borgia. Non noſtri generis monstrum nec ſanguinis.</hi> Of that attempt to cut off King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with one blow, none could be capable, but ſuch as had many years breathed the ſame aire where he reigned, who wiſhed that the Romans had but one neck, that he might cut it off with one ſtroke. But a Jeſuite is capable of deviſing, and the Romiſh zeal of executing any miſchief, though never ſo prodigious, to promote the Papal intereſt. And they have law for it, even the Roman Decree, the Oracle of the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>We do not account them for</hi>

               <p>Truly ſo far we muſt excuſe <hi>Campian, Garnet, Hall, Hamond,</hi> and other Jeſuites, who have plotted or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged rebellions and treaſons in <hi>England.</hi> They have done no more then they were commanded or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Pope.

Actors were grounded upon the fundamental Laws of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> And that the Pope the Head of their Faith, is he that commands by his Canons and Bulls the slaughter of thoſe that diſpleaſe him, the breach of faith, the depoſing of Kings, and the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of the people, as I have ſufficiently demonſtrated before.

               <p>This power of depoſing Kings, and expoſing them to the attempts of their enemies, ſo peremptorily aſſumed by the Pope, and ſo boldly executed by his zealous agents, ought to be grounded upon ſome proof out of holy Writ.

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Some Aſſertions of the Libeller are examined.</head>
               <p>AFter I have vindicated the Proteſtant Religion from the aſperſion of Rebellion, and laid that charge in its proper place, I have done my main buſineſs. And now partly out of compaſſion, partly out of contempt, I will paſs by moſt of the untruths of this Libeller, which are well nigh as many as his lines, contenting my ſelf to have diſproved two of<note place="margin">pag. 109.</note> them. The one, <hi>That the Rebel-doctrines are back'd by the generality of them that call themſelves Proteſtants.</hi> But I have proved the contrary by their publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions.</p>
               <p>This plain dealing of his is towards the latter end of his Book: He durſt not have ſpoken ſo in the beginning. But he muſt amuſe the Reader a great while with rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the Presbyterians, or the Proteſtants of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:204612:81"/>
before he charge the generality of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtants with rebellion. Beſides, he might hope tha few would have the patience to read his book ſo far.</p>
               <p>This is worſe. <hi>In this Century of years</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there have been more Princes depoſed and murthered for their Religion by theſe Proteſtants of Integrity, then have been in all the others ſince Chriſts time by the Popes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications, or the attempts and means of the Roman Catholicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not eaſie to determine whether malice or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be prevalent in that aſſertion. I have ſhewed by unreproachable teſtimonies, that the Popes have filled Chriſtendome with ſedition and rebellion for many centuries of yeers; and what the Jeſuites have been act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing undet them in this laſt Century. To which ſince the Libeller confines himſelf, it had been no hard task to name thoſe many Kings depoſed and murthered by the Proteſtants ſo lately, if the aſſertion had any truth in it.</p>
               <p>When did a Proteſtant Miniſter thruſt his knife into his Sovereignes body, as the Monk <hi>James Clement</hi> did to his King <hi>Henry</hi> the III. and as the Jeſuite <hi>Campian</hi> would have done to his Sovereigne Queen <hi>Elizabeth?</hi> When did a Miniſter inſtruct any to kill his King, as the Jeſuites did <hi>Parry,</hi> the Jeſuite <hi>Walpole, Edward Squire,</hi> The Jeſuite <hi>Holt, Patrick, Cullen, York,</hi> and <hi>Williams;</hi> The Jeſuite <hi>Parſons, Heskec</hi> to tempt the Earl of <hi>Darby</hi> to rebellion? Or as the Jeſuite <hi>Varade</hi> inſtructed <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere</hi> to kill <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. of <hi>France,</hi> and the whole Colledge of the Jeſuites <hi>John Chaſiell:</hi> Or what Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, either of the Clergie or Laity was known to have
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:204612:81"/>
made an attempt againſt the life of his Sovereigne? For the late Engliſh Traytors who brought their moſt excellent Sovereigne to the Scaffold, are no more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants then they are Papiſts, and are Jeſuites in the point of obedience.</p>
               <p>When this Libeller called the Miniſters of <hi>Scotland rare Saltpeter men, fit for fireworks, and to prepare matter to blow up both Church and State,</hi> Did he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he gave them the right ſtyle belonging to the Jeſuites <hi>Garnet, Hall, Hammond, Gerard</hi> and <hi>Greenville?</hi> For theſe were <hi>Saltpeter-men</hi> with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and without metaphor, <hi>prepared matter to blow up Church and State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Was it ever put to the charge of a Proteſtant Divine, Chaplain to his Prince, that he recommended to him a man ſent by his enemies to make him away? Or that he made queſtions to the Devil about his life? Or that he ſent word to his enemies of ſuch things as he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto him to eaſe his Conſcience, as the Jeſuite <hi>Cotton</hi> did? Or did ever our Divines blow the doctrine of King-killing into ignorant ſouls, as the Jeſuites did to <hi>Ravaillac;</hi> who being moſt rude, and a very Brute in all other points of Religion, was found by his exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miners exquiſitely skilful in all the evaſions and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Jeſuites about that horrible doctrine? Or did any convicted Traytor depoſe that he had declared his purpoſe to a Miniſter, and ſhewed him the knife for the execution, as <hi>Ravaillac</hi> maintained to Father <hi>Aubigni</hi> before his Judges? Some ſuch charges which might be juſtified by Records of Courts, and Judicial proceedings, this Accuſer would have brought, if there
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:204612:82"/>
had been any; and we are ſure that he would not have ſpared us. If ever any man deſerved to be ſued upon an Action of Slander, it is this Libeller; for thus ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the generality of the Proteſtants, and the State, of which he is a Subject. But I fear that if a Purſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant were ſent for him, he would return and anſwer, <hi>Non est inventus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for his ſaying, That <hi>the doctrine of</hi> Rome, <hi>with the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">page 110.</note> 
                  <hi>opinions and practiſes of all its Doctors, are (as he hath ſhewed) quite contrary to rebellion, and all that is ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Church in this particular is meer calumnly.</hi> Let the world judge whether he hath ſhewed what he ſaith, and whether is more credible, his ſaying, or my proving. Yet becauſe he ſtands for the Roman Church, I deſire my Reader to take notice, that in this point of obedience, my quarrel hath been with the Court, not with the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> between which I conceive as much difference, as between the Wind and the Sea. The Church might be quiet enough from ſtorms of rebellion, did not the boyſterous wind of ſedition make it foam, blown from the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> by its agents the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites.</p>
               <p>After that the Libeller had railed againſt us, he falls upon a common place of loyalty, and brings ſome texts of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> taken out of Proteſtant books made by our Reverend Divines againſt the late Rebels. For that he is not acquainted with S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> he ſhews it by the commendation he giveth him, calling him <hi>the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>
                  <note place="margin">pag. 119.</note> 
                  <hi>and learned Father of the Chriſtian Church.</hi> S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> deſerveth a better commendation, but he is neither the moſt ancient, nor the moſt learned of the Fathers.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:204612:82"/>
Moſt of thoſe whom the Church calls Fathers, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, for he dyed in the fifth Century; And as for Learning, <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> were far beyond him. Could the Engliſh Seminaries pitch upon no abler Champion to fight againſt us then this raw ſouldier? A more paſſionate and leſs reaſonable Writer I never met with. His ſtyle is a perpetual barking, and biting too, but without teeth. I could lay up a great heap of his untruths, ignorances, and impertinencies, if I would make ſuch a wilde-gooſe-chaſe as to follow him in all his falſe turns: But both my Readers and I have better buſineſſes then to heap up dung, or ſearch all the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of a Novice of the Ieſuites.</p>
               <p>For the end, he brings ſome rules of Law concerning the nature of the Engliſh Monarchy; which if he had ſtudied well, he had never taken upon him to defend the doctrine of the Ieſuites, which is inconſiſtent with them: For they allow not that which he affirmeth; <hi>That the Monarchy of</hi> England <hi>can do no homage, having no ſuperiour; and that the Crown of</hi> England <hi>is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, and his</hi> jura Regalia <hi>are holden of no Lord but the Lord of heaven. Bellarmine</hi> ſaith the clean contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and makes the Pope Sovereigne of <hi>England</hi> by dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble right, as we heard before. Yet this Scholar of the Ieſuites may give <hi>Bellarmines</hi> ſenſe to that aſſertion, that the Crown of <hi>England</hi> is independent; for holding with his Maſters, that the Crown of <hi>England</hi> belongeth to the Pope, he will ſay alſo that it is independent, and oweth homage to none but God; meaning, that the Pope, the right Sovereigne, oweth homage for it to none but God. The man being evidently a Scholar of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:204612:83"/>
the Jeſuites, cannot but be inſtructed in the doctrine of equivocations, about which <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi>

                  <hi>uſe theſe equivocations, whenſoever it is neceſſary or uſeful for the preſervation of body, honour or estate.</hi> Since then the ſect and Religion of the Jeſuites, which ſubjecteth the Crown of <hi>England</hi> unto the Pope, cannot ſubſiſt in <hi>England</hi> without palliating that criminal doctrine with equivocation: They finde it neceſſary for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of body, honour, and eſtate, to profeſs that <hi>the Monarchy of</hi> England <hi>can do no homage, having no ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour; and that the Crown of</hi> England <hi>is independent:</hi> but to whom that independant Crown belongs, that they will reſerve in their thoughts. Or if they ſay they will be true to the King, they will by the King under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Pope, or the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to whom the Pope gave the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> fourſcore years ago, and never recalled that gift ſince.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if this Gentleman appear in Print again, or any of his confreres for him about this point of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, we muſt deſire him to ſpeak more home, before he can juſtifie himſelf to be a true <hi>Philanax Anglicus,</hi> and a good Engliſh ſubject of his Majeſty. To that end let him declare that he acknowledgeth the following Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:204612:83"/>
as true and juſt, and is ready to ſubſcribe unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>I.</label> The Kings Moſt Excellent Majeſty <hi>Charles</hi> the II. hath no ſuperiour on Earth, <hi>de jure,</hi> in the Kingdoms of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and other His Majeſties Dominions.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>II.</label> All Roman Catholicks born in theſe His Majeſties Dominions, are his ſubjects, <hi>de jure,</hi> and of none elſe, although they have taken the Orders of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or have a General of ſome Religion to whom they have ſworn obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>III.</label> The Doctrine of Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is falſe, that the King of <hi>England</hi> is ſubject to the Pope by double right, beſides his pretended ſubjection in matters ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>IV.</label> The Pope hath no power to deprive Kings of their Kingdoms, or any way to diſpoſe of their Crowns or their Lives.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>V.</label> The Pope cannot abſolve the ſubjects of His Majeſty King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. or of any of His Succeſſors, from the Oath of their Allegiance. Neither are they now abſolved from it by any precedent Decree from the Popes.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>VI.</label> A King declared heretick or excommunicate by the Pope, is not thereby diſabled from exerciſing his Kingly juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>

                  <label>VII.</label> The excommunicating or depriving of a King by the Pope, doth not exempt that Kings natural ſubjects from the duty of their Allegiance.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>VIII.</label> King <hi>John</hi> had no power to give his Kingdome to the Pope, without the conſent of his Peers and Commons: Neither is that Contract of any validity.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>IX.</label> A Prieſt having learned in Confeſſion a Conſpiracy againſt the Kings life, ought to diſcover it to the King or his Councel.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>X.</label> The Peers and Commons of <hi>England,</hi> and other His Majeſties Dominions, have no power to judge their King, much leſs to depoſe him, or put him to death, or to chooſe another King, or to alter the Government of the State.</p>
               <p>He that will refuſe to ſubſcribe theſe Articles, and openly profeſs his conſent unto them, cannot juſtifie his love and fidelity to the King, and is altogether unfit to charge the Proteſtants with rebellious tenets. <hi>Vacuum culpa eſſe decet qui in alium paratus est dicere.</hi> He that is in an error cannot juſtifie himſelf but by forſaking it. That yeilding is glorious; and to be overcome by the truth is a great victory. Without ſuch a juſtification, leſſons of loyalty given by a Ieſuite are unſuitable, and of as little effect as a Lecture of Chaſtity preach'd by an allowed Curtizan of <hi>Rome.</hi>
